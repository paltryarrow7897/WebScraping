0,大人,ADULT,"""I'm an adult, which means I have adult responsibilities. Oh, Toner (おとな)? I need some of that for my terrible printer..."" ... now feel so sad you have such a terrible printer that runs out of toner every day. Ohhhh Toner!","This kanji combines big and person. If you're a child, how do you think of adults? You just think of them like big people. That's why this combination of kanji means adult, and when used like an adjective, it means mature.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A7%E4%BA%BA
1,一人,ALONE,"The reading for this vocab doesn't follow any rules you learned previously. It's an exception, which means you have to learn the reading separately too. Spend a few moments trying to remember this word, look away for 10 seconds, and then try to recall its reading. Could you do it? Try again, this time in thirty seconds. Did you do it again? Okay, go ahead and move on. You may know it now, though you'll need to recall it again in the next 5-10 minutes if you want to remember it for good.
Alternatively, if you know the reading for the vocab word 一つ (in the same level as this word), you can know that it uses the same reading!","When there's one person, what are they? Well, they're either just going to be simply one person or alone.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%BA
2,人工,ARTIFICIAL,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Remember this by thinking about how jeans (じん) are artificial. You've never seen jeans growing on trees, right? Nope, jeans are 100% man made.","A person of industry makes a lot of things by hand, so everything they make is artificial, and also means it's man made.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%BA%E5%B7%A5
3,大きい,BIG,"What do you do when you see something really, really big? You say おお because you can't believe your eyes. Imagine something really large and say おお out loud to help seal the memory in that brain of yours.","This is the adjective form of big. It has the same meaning, though it is a word for describing. Words that end with い are often adjectives, remember that for future words as well. So, as long as you know the meaning of this kanji, you can transfer that to the meaning of this word. It's the adjective big, or large.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%84
4,下,DOWN,"When a vocab is a single kanji and is alone it tends to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, so now it's time to learn the kun'yomi reading to learn this vocabulary word.
What's below you? What's below your foot? Oh no. The worst thing possible: It's した.","When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal the meaning of the kanji it comes from. So, this one is below or down.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8B
5,八,EIGHT,"When a vocab is a single kanji and all alone like this, it's usually going to use the kun'yomi. But, because this is a number (exception) it uses the on'yomi instead, meaning you already know the reading from when you learned the kanji!",When a vocab is a single kanji it usually steals its meaning from its kanji as well. Same goes for this vocab word. It means eight.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%AB
6,八つ,EIGHT THINGS,"Since all of the ""number of things"" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).
So what eight things do you have? You have eight yachts (やっつ). Go ahead and count them. They're beautiful. Also, be sure not to be confused by this particular reading mnemonic. It includes the つ, even though the つ is outside the reading you need to learn (just makes things easier for you overall). Since you can see the つ outside, it shouldn't be too difficult for you.","This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for eight plus つ. So, this one is eight things.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%AB%E3%81%A4
7,入り口,ENTRANCE,"This word is really two separate words put together to form one, so let's look at it in two parts:
The kanji 入 has り attached to it as okurigana (hiragana that comes after a kanji), so you can bet that 入り will use a kun'yomi reading for the kanji. You haven't learned this reading yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
The entrance you're going through is really eerie (いり). It has cobwebs and creepy figures carved into it, and it just gives you a really eerie feeling.
Since 入り uses the kun'yomi, you can guess that 口 will follow suit. You learned this reading with the vocabulary, but the く in くち changes to ぐ due to something called rendaku. Think of it as an eerie entrance into the Gucci (ぐち) store.",A mouth that you enter is an entrance.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8A%E5%8F%A3
8,大した,GREAT,"The reading for the 大 part is actually the on'yomi reading you learned when learning its kanji. So, as long as you remember that (and remember to use that reading), you can read this word as well. 大した = たいした.","した is the past tense form of する (which means ""to do""). So, essentially this word is ""did big."" What is something that ""did big""? It's something that's great or considerable.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A7%E3%81%97%E3%81%9F
9,山,MOUNTAIN,"When a vocab is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's usually going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn when you learned the kanji. To remember this word's reading we'll use a mnemonic.
What are you doing going up into the mountains? You're hunting for yams (やま). Go ahead, imagine yourself doing just that, climbing up the mountain (it's hard work!) and then digging in the ground with your hands, then pulling up that sweet, delicious yam! Mmm!",A vocab made of a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) usually has the same exact meaning as the kanji it's made from. So by that you know that this vocab's meaning is mountain.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B1%B1
10,口,MOUTH,"When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you did not learn from learning the kanji. To remember this word, you should use a mnemonic. With your mouth, make a ""kuchi kuchi kou"" (くち) sound. Go ahead, make it. Focus on your mouth and try to imagine each shape it makes while zooming in on it. You're talking to a baby, which is why you're making all these ridiculous noises. Also, instead of ""coo"" at the end, you're saying ""kou,"" because that's the reading of the kanji (こう).
くちくちこう！くちくちこう！ Sounds like something from Arrested Development, actually.","When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it's generally going to have the same meaning as the kanji it came from. From that, you know this word's meaning is mouth.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8F%A3
11,ふじ山,MT FUJI,"Normally ふじ would be in kanji, but I wanted you to see this kanji use in action since it's more useful than just being used on Mount Fuji. This is treated like a jukugo word (combo kanji word). In the case of jukugo, usually the on'yomi reading is used, meaning you just have to remember the on'yomi reading of 山. Luckily, you learned this when you were learning the kanji, so you should already know it!","Just look at this word. What do you think it means? That's right - it's a name (Fuji) plus the kanji for mountain. Put those together, and you have Mount Fuji. In English the ""Mount(ain)"" part comes first. In Japanese, it comes at the end, sort of like the name ender さん, ちゃん, and so on. You can add 山 to the end of any mountain's name too, not just Mount Fuji.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%81%B5%E3%81%98%E5%B1%B1
12,九,NINE,"When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are the exception, as you might already know. When they're alone with no okurigana they're the on'yomi reading, which you should already know from learning the kanji that makes up this word.","When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it often has the same meaning as the kanji it's based off of. Same goes for the word 九, as well. It has the same meaning as its kanji counterpart.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B9%9D
13,九つ,NINE THINGS,"Since all of the ""number of things"" words all follow the same pattern (number plus つ), you really just have to remember the part before the つ (and then remember that the つ is in all of these). All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).
What thing do you have nine of? The nine things that you have are nine coconuts (ここの). Imagine yourself juggling nine coconuts in the air. Try counting them while you're doing this, arriving at nine things.","This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for nine plus つ. So, this one is nine things.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B9%9D%E3%81%A4
14,一,ONE,"When a vocab word is all alone and has no okurigana (hiragana attached to kanji) connected to it, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, however. When a number is all alone, with no kanji or okurigana, it is going to be the on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji. Just remember this exception for alone numbers and you'll be able to read future number-related vocab to come.","As is the case with most vocab words that consist of a single kanji, this vocab word has the same meaning as the kanji it parallels, which is one.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%80

All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).
So, you have one thing. What one thing do you have? You have one of He-Man's Toes, aka a single He-Toe (ひと). So what's the thing you have only one of? You have one He-Toe. Imagine He-Man walking around with one missing toe, trying to find you so he can get it back. At least you'll be able to run faster than him now.","This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is. For this one, it's the kanji for one plus つ. So, this one is one thing.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%80%E3%81%A4
16,人,PERSON,"When a vocab is a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Since you don't know the kun'yomi reading for this kanji yet, let's use a mnemonic to learn it.
What does a person hate more than anything? They hate extreme heat (ひと). You can always put on more clothes to stay warm, but when the heat gets too high, you can only take off so much.","When a vocab is a single kanji all alone, it usually has the same meaning as its kanji parent. That goes for this vocab word as well. Person is person.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%BA
17,下さい,PLEASE GIVE ME,"The reading for this word is an exceptional reading. You just have to be able to recall the くだ part, though (since さい is already there in the form of the hiragana). So, think about why you have to be polite to this misbehaving kid. Turns out, if you don't, he has the power to initiate a Coup d'état against you and your family, who runs the government. Just imagine yourself thinking over and over ""Okay... I have to be nice to this kid. If I don't... he'll initiate a Coup d'état... and that would ruin my family..."" You're walking on thin ice, here.","You know that the kanji 下 means down and that さい sounds like the word ""sigh."" You need to ask someone for something, so you look down, sigh, and say please give me that thing. You're ashamed that you have to ask. But you still need it. Please, please give it to me!
We only use this kanji version of ください when we're asking for something, that's why it's ""please give me."" If you're just saying ""please"" you don't need the kanji at all!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%95%E3%81%84
18,人口,POPULATION,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Here at Tofugu, we measure population in jeans (じん). Each of us has just one pair of jeans, so if you know the jean count you know the population.",The amount of people with mouths (that you have to feed) is the population that you have to feed.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%BA%E5%8F%A3
19,力,POWER,"When a vocab word is a single kanji all alone with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji), it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn the kun'yomi reading with the kanji, so for this vocab word, we'll use a mnemonic.
The most powerful man in the world. All his power came from his cheek (ちから). Imagine him blowing up his cheek like a giant balloon, then unleashing his power on you. Thwap thwap thwap thwap.","When a vocab word is made up of a single kanji and that's it, it almost always takes the meaning from its parent kanji. So, this vocab word also means power.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8A%9B
20,川,RIVER,You're in luck - the reading you learned with the kanji is the same as the one you have to learn for this vocab!,"When a vocab is made up of a single kanji with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it will usually take the same meaning as the kanji it comes from. So, from that you know that this word means river.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B7%9D
21,七,SEVEN,"Most single-kanji all-alone vocab words like this use the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this rule. That being said, four and seven are exceptions to this exception to the rule (because the on'yomi readings sound too much like the word for ""death""). You should learn both readings for this word, though we're going to go with なな for the main one here. You can remember that because you had seven nanas after you.","When a vocab is alone with no okurigana (that's hiragana attached to a kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji too. That goes for this word as well. So, if you know the kanji's meaning (seven) you'll know the vocab's meaning (seven).",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%83

What thing do you have seven of? The seven things that you have are seven Nanas (なな). These are your grandmas, cloned. Just think, ""It's lucky to have seven nanas. They can all cook my favorite foods for me!""","This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end. Whenever you see this, you know the word means ""____ things."" Knowing that, as long as you know the kanji (which you do) you can figure out what number of things it is.

23,大きさ,SIZE,"When a vocab has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it is probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. Since you learned the on'yomi reading with the kanji 大, we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember this word.
When you saw the size of (pick something surprising), you said ""おお *#$@!"" Really imagine something surprising. Say the おお part out loud, as well. Think about the size of whatever you're looking at, too, and how big it is.","In Japanese, さ on the end of a word is often the equivalent of ""-ness"" in English. In other words, if you replace the い on the end of an い-adjective with さ, you have a noun. In this case, the adjective is 大きい (big) and the noun 大きさ means ""bigness"", aka size.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A7%E3%81%8D%E3%81%95
24,十,TEN,"When a vocab is alone and consists of a single kanji like this, usually it uses the kun'yomi reading for the kanji. But, numbers are an exception and they use the on'yomi reading (which you learned when you learned the kanji). That means you know that this word's reading is じゅう already.",When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it tends to steal its meaning from the kanji it came from. That means this vocab word also means ten.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8D%81
25,三,THREE,"When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi reading when you learned this kanji, so you already know that the reading for this vocab is さん.","When a vocab is a single kanji and alone like this, it usually steals its meaning from the parent kanji. That goes for this word too, making the meaning of this word three.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%89
26,三人,THREE PEOPLE,"This is a jukugo (kanji compound) word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Apparently, there are three people working as Santa-san at Nintendo (さんにん)! It's a big company, so obviously they need three Santas.",You have the kanji for three and person. Common sense will tell you what this word is. It's three people.,1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%89%E4%BA%BA

All of the readings are the kun'yomi reading, which means we'll have to use a mnemonic to remember them (you know the on'yomi reading of the kanji portion).
What thing do you have three of? The three things that you have are actually three versions of yourself. ""Who is the real one?"" you ask yourself. ""It's me!"" ""Wait, no, it's me!"" Just remember that there are three of you, and they're all saying ""me me me me me"" to try and prove that they're the real you.","This word follows the ""number of things"" pattern where there's a kanji for a number plus つ on the end.

28,入る,TO ENTER,"When a vocab is a single kanji with okurigana, chances are it's going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you don't usually learn in the kanji (you usually learn the on'yomi reading). So, let's learn the kun'yomi reading for this word using its meaning.
When you enter the room, what do you do? You say ""Hi"" (はい) to everyone to the point of absurdity. ""Hi there. Oh hi Frank. Oh hi there Susan. Oh hi there lamp.""","This vocab word has okurigana, which is the hiragana part that comes after the kanji. When a vocab's okurigana makes an ""う/oo"" sound (in this case, we have a る), it's often going to be a verb. So in this case, the kanji 入 is enter. The vocab 入る is to enter. We're just taking the kanji and using it in a verb!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8B
29,上げる,TO LIFT SOMETHING,"Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to use the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:
You want to lift something, and that something is aardvark (あ) above your head. Why? Because even though aardvarks have long tongues, they can't reach the ants in the trees. But when you raise this aardvark it can get at those yummy ants!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means above and this verb is related to that meaning. It means to lift something or to raise something. It's a transitive verb, meaning that you do something to something else. You raise something. Like your hands!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8A%E3%81%92%E3%82%8B
30,下げる,TO LOWER SOMETHING,"Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading, which you didn't learn with the kanji. Here's a mnemonic to help you:
You want to lower something. In this case, it's a tree, so you need a saw (さ). Lower the tree to the ground gently while you slowly saw it down!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means below so the verb version of that is when you put something below you. It's to lower something. It can also mean to hang something, such as a lamp from the ceiling.
This is a transitive verb, which means that the verb is done by one entity onto another. In other words, you lower something. Like your impossibly high expectations for yourself. Take it easy!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8B%E3%81%92%E3%82%8B
31,二,TWO,"When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading!

32,二人,TWO PEOPLE,"The reading for this word is quite strange. If you know 二つ's reading, you can use that to remember the 二 part (ふた). But, the り that is the 人 is a total exception, something you won't see too often (though you may have seen it in 一人). If you can use the reading of 一人 (aka if you've learned it already) then definitely use that. If not, do your best to remember the reading on your own.

So what thing do you have two of? The two things that you have consist of one foot and another foot (ふた). Remember from the on'yomi how you had two knees (for the reading に)?

Above you is a huge weight. You're holding it up and struggling (it's heavy!). You look up and try to crane your neck to see how much it weighs (うえ), but you can't see the numbers on the side of it. How long can you hold it above your head like this?","When a vocab word is a single kanji and alone, it tends to steal the meaning from the kanji. Same goes for this one too. It means above or up.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8A
35,力いっぱい,WITH ALL ONE'S STRENGTH,力 uses the same reading as you learned with the vocabulary. That's because this is basically two separate words stuck together.,"You've hopefully already learned that 力 means ""power"". You might have also heard the word いっぱい, because it's used a lot in conversation. It has a few meanings (you'll learn more of them later) but the important one here is ""full"" or ""a lot"". Put these two words together and you have full power, with all one’s strength, and as hard as one can. Remember this one with all your strength!
Just a side note: いっぱい can also be written in kanji, which you'll learn later on! However, in simple words like this one it's usually written in kana.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8A%9B%E3%81%84%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%81%84

Also, this is a specific month, so it uses the がつ reading.","月 in Japanese means ""moon"" but it also means ""month."" Why? Probably because the moon takes about a month to get through its cycles.

40,丸,CIRCLE,"The reading you learned for this kanji is the kun'yomi one. Since this vocab word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Guess what? That means you already know it!",This vocab word and the kanji that makes it have the same meaning: Circle.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%B8
41,丸い,CIRCULAR,"This word uses the reading you learned for the kanji 丸, though you'll need to tack the い onto the end too.","With an い on the end, you can guess that this word is an い-adjective. What is the adjective version of the kanji 丸? ""Circle"" becomes circular, spherical or round. This, compared to another similar word (円), is more general purpose and can be used with 3D spherical objects as well.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%B8%E3%81%84
42,正しい,CORRECT,"This word uses a reading you didn't learn from the kanji. You have to remember the ただ portion in order to read this word, so think about it this way:
After you get the answer correct a clown jumps out of nowhere yelling ""TA DA!!!"" Imagine it scaring the crap out of you, too.","Ending with an い tells you that this word is an い-adjective. So since you know that the kanji 正 means ""correct,"" what is the adjective version of that word? Well, it's also correct.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%97%E3%81%84
43,犬,DOG,"Since this is a word made up of a single kanji and nothing else, you can assume that this word will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading you learned for this kanji happens to be the kun'yomi reading as well. So if you know the kanji you know the reading.",This vocab made up of a single kanji shares its meaning with said single kanji. That meaning is dog.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%8A%AC
44,八日,EIGHTH DAY,"Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:
Every eighth day you have to buy yogurt to fuel your car (ようか). Your car runs on yogurt, but it needs to be refilled every eight days to keep running. It's really inconvenient because it's just ONE day more than a week. And a week just feels better. Oh well.","Eighth day or day eight. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%AB%E6%97%A5
45,夕べ,EVENING,"When hiragana is attached to a kanji, you can usually assume that that kanji is going to be read using the kun'yomi reading, which is exactly what's going on with this word as well. By learning this word's kanji you've also learned the reading for this word.","This vocab word has a weird little extra bit on it (the べ). You can sort of ignore that, it doesn't really mean anything in particular. The meaning of this vocab word and the kanji it comes from are the same: evening",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%95%E3%81%B9
46,出口,EXIT,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 出口 is an exception to this rule, however, and uses its kun'yomi readings. There's no particular reason why this is, but oftentimes a ""body part"" word (like mouth) changes a word to use kun'yomi readings instead of on'yomi ones. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 口 (くち) from learning the vocab, but to remember the reading for 出 you can think the following:
If I exit out this mouth, I'll end up in the ocean (you were swallowed by a whale) and I will surely end up dead (で).
Also keep in mind that because of rendaku, くち becomes ぐち.","The mouth you exit out of is just a doorway (I hope), but an easier way to describe this word or concept is to call it an exit.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%87%BA%E5%8F%A3
47,目,EYE,"The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%9B%AE
48,目玉,EYEBALL,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. 目玉, however, is an exception. Perhaps this is because it includes a body part (the eye) in it, which often makes a word switch to kun'yomi readings. Either way, it doesn't matter too much. Both the readings you learned for the kanji in this word are the kun'yomi, meaning you should know how to read this one. Just make sure you watch out for the rendaku.","What is an eye ball? Oh wait, that's easy. It's an eyeball!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%9B%AE%E7%8E%89
49,二月,FEBRUARY,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That is true with this word as well. Make sure to take note that 月 is using the がつ reading and not the げつ one. This is true for all ""month words"" in Japanese.","The kanji 月 means both month and moon (because moon cycles take about a month, presumably). So, what is the number two month? It's not January... it's not March... it's February!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%8C%E6%9C%88
50,五日,FIFTH DAY,"Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:
On the fifth day I have to eat (いつ) five cars (か). Now imagine yourself eating five cars. How did you manage to get past the first one? I'm impressed.","Day five or the fifth day. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%94%E6%97%A5
51,五十,FIFTY,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. That's the case for this word too, which means you should already know how to read this word.",What happens when you have ten five times? You get fifty!,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%94%E5%8D%81
52,火,FIRE,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
What comes off of fire? Lots and lots of heat (ひ). Feel it coming off the fire, touching and warming your face.","This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: fire.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%81%AB
53,五,FIVE,"Since numbers are an exception, this word is read using the on'yomi reading even though it's made from a single kanji all alone. Luckily for you, you learned the reading for this word when you learned the parent kanji.","This vocab is made from a single kanji, which means it shares the same meaning as the parent kanji: Five.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%94
54,五つ,FIVE THINGS,"The reading of this word is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji 五, meaning you didn't learn it when you learned the parent kanji reading. To remember this word, think of it this way:
You have five things. What do you have to do with them? You need to eat (いつ) them. If you come up with something crazy you have to eat, and focus on the fact that you must eat five of these things, it will help a lot too.","From previous number+つ words, you can probably guess that this word means five things.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%94%E3%81%A4
55,四,FOUR,"When a vocab is alone like this with no okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually uses its kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception, though, and use the on'yomi reading. However, four and seven actually use both. We're going to go with the kun'yomi reading here, and since you haven't learned this reading yet, here's a mnemonic to help you:
You have to count to four. But you're tired. One... two... three... *YAWN* ... four. There, you did it. But *yawn* now you can't stop yawning. You're so, so sleepy. Four is too high a number to count without falling asleep.
By the way! Both the reading よん and し are pretty common, but because the on'yomi reading し sounds just like the word for ""death,"" it isn't used as much. Generally when you're just counting (for example, ""1, 2, 3, 4...""), you will use the reading し. But when you are counting things or people, you'll use よん. There are exceptions to this, but you'll learn them as they come up.","This vocab word has the same meaning as its parent kanji (single alone kanji usually do that!), meaning it means four.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%9B%9B
56,天才,GENIUS,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. As long as you know the readings for these kanji, you should be able to read this word just fine.",A genius from heaven is still a genius.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A9%E6%89%8D

58,女の子,GIRL,"Since there's hiragana in here, you can bet that these kanji will use the kun'yomi readings. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 女. The only thing I have to make sure that you know is 子. When you need to remember the kun'yomi reading of 子, just think about you fighting a child (you're a jerk, apparently!). When you hit him in the face, he flies to the floor, and the ref calls out ""KO!"" because you just knocked the poor kid out.","Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana stuck in the middle you can guess that it is like putting two separate words that you've learned together into one word. This hiragana is の, a particle that makes something possessive. In this case, the 子 is of the 女. Basically, this suggests that the woman is a child, aka a girl.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A5%B3%E3%81%AE%E5%AD%90
59,上手,GOOD AT,"Both of these kanji use on'yomi reading, though 手 uses an on'yomi reading you didn't learn with the kanji. It's a rare reading, so it wasn't included (and we just have to deal with exceptions like this as we go along). To remember the reading for this word, here's a mnemonic:
What are you good at? You're really good at taking Jourm (じょう) to the zoo (ず). No one else can take Jourm to the zoo, he gets mad and throws them into the animal enclosures. But you? Jourm trusts you.",Think of someone holding out their hand. This is average. Things rated below the hand are things you're bad at.

60,手,HAND,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Since this is a body part, the kun'yomi reading usually takes priority. That means you learned the kun'yomi reading already when you learned the kanji.","The kanji means hand, and the word means hand too! It can also be used to refer to your whole arm.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%89%8B
61,天,HEAVEN,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it would normally use the kun'yomi reading. The kanji that makes this word only has one important reading, though, and that happens to be the on'yomi. Since you learned the on'yomi reading for this kanji, you've already learned the reading for this word.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A9

He is the knocker (なか).",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%AD
64,一月,JANUARY,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. This is a specific month, so it uses the がつ reading.","Since the kanji 月 mean both moon and month (because a moon cycle is about a month, presumably), what is the number one month?

65,日本,JAPAN,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well, though take note that the 日 portion is shortened a bit. So instead of being にち it is just に.","Remember the secondary meaning of 本? It's ""origin."" So, this word technically means ""sun origin."" Does that sound familiar?

Look up at that big, bright moon. You have to open it up and take what's inside. To do that, you are required to have two keys (つき), and they have to be turned at the same time.

The reading for first day, however, is a big old exception. It doesn’t take the on’yomi or kun’yomi readings, and has its own special (weird) readings. Here’s a mnemonic to help you remember this one:
On the first day of a new relationship you just tweet a cheesy (ついたち) line at each other.

Luckily, that's the reading you learned with the only kanji in this word, so you should be able to read it!","ねぎ means ""onion"" in Japanese. But, there are different kinds of onions, right?

Well, the 女 part comes before the 王 when it's a queen, because the queen always comes before the princess (they're usually pretty selfish in the stories, right?). As for the princess, the 女 comes after the king, because she doesn't have as much power. That's why this one is princess.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%8E%8B%E5%A5%B3
83,子犬,PUPPY,"Even though this is a jukugo word, it doesn't use the on'yomi readings. Both the kanji 子 and 犬 often favor kun'yomi readings, and this word is no exception.

Look to the right. There are meat geese (みぎ) over there. What are meat geese, you ask? They're geese made of meat, that sit to the right of you, trying to get you to do bad things.

87,円い,ROUND,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
The reading for the 円 portion of this word is the same as a kanji you're learning in this level: 丸. That kanji means something really similar to this kanji. And guess what? They also share a reading. So, if you know that the reading of 丸 is まる then you'll also know that the reading for this word is まる!","This word is made up of a single kanji with hiragana attached to it. That hiragana ends with い which means it's an adjective. So, what's the adjective form of the kanji that's in this word? 円 means both ""yen"" and ""round"" but in this case we're looking at the round one (because something isn't going to be ""yenny""). The adjective version of round is round or circular. Just like a yen coin, this ""round"" is a flat round. As in, if you draw a circle on a piece of paper, you could use this word. Same goes with yen, which is why ""yen"" and ""round"" both use the same kanji.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%86%86%E3%81%84
88,二日,SECOND DAY,"Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:
The circus is in town this weekend and you can't wait to get there. You want to show off your new foots car (ふつか) to all the circus clowns.

You've been stuck inside working for seven days and today you finally have a day off.

The cow (moo / むい) is standing on top of your car (か). Why? Because you only feed the cow once a week, and that is on the seventh day. He's standing there on the sixth day because he's super hungry and knows it's almost time.",It's the kanji for six and day.

93,六つ,SIX THINGS,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can guess that it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you do that:
What are the six things that you need to count? This time you are counting six cows (むっつ). The reason it's six, you know, is because you wanted a half a dozen cows. No more, no less.","Any number with a つ attached to it means you are counting that number of things. In this case, it's six things.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%AD%E3%81%A4
94,小さい,SMALL,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to remember the ちい portion:
When you think of the word small, try to think of this cheese (ちい) store. You go inside, and all of their cheeses are so small. They hand you a magnifying glass to see all the cheeses. You look at them and exclaim: ""Why are these cheeses so small???""","This kanji has hiragana attached and ends with an い sound. That means it's probably an adjective (and it is!). So, if you take the kanji 小 and its meaning (small), you can figure out the adjective version of it. What is the adjective version of ""small?"" Actually, it's the same thing: small.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B0%8F%E3%81%95%E3%81%84
95,土,SOIL,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:
You look through the soil. You're trying to find something. As you dig and sift, you come across not one but two cheeses (つち). Pull them out of the ground and put them in your mouth. How do the two cheeses taste and compare?",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%9C%9F
96,日,SUN,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:
What do you feel from the sun? You feel the heat (ひ).","The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. Take note that this word means both ""sun"" and ""day,"" though. Why? because the sun takes a day to go around and come back!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%97%A5
97,刀,SWORD,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. I'm hoping you already know this word - that will make everything much easier. It's かたな (you know what a katana is, right?).",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well!,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%80
98,十日,TENTH DAY,"Words that count days use an exceptional reading. Even though this is a jukugo word, it uses kun'yomi readings for both the kanji. Think about this word this way:
On the tenth day, they'll tow your car (とおか). They'll let it sit there for ten days, but any more than that and they'll tow it, so watch out.","Tenth day or day ten. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8D%81%E6%97%A5
99,三日,THIRD DAY,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Counting days, however, are an exception (at least up to ten). You need to use the kun'yomi readings to read this word. You already know the kun'yomi reading for 三 from when you learned the word 三つ. Here is a way to remember the reading for 日:
On the third day you have to give me (み) a ride in your car (か). I don't have a car of my own, so don't forget me, okay?","Third day or day three. No matter how you look at this word, it makes a lot of sense.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%89%E6%97%A5
100,千,THOUSAND,"Normally a single kanji making up a word like this means it will use the kun'yomi readings. Numbers are generally the exception, though, which means this word uses the on'yomi reading. If you learned the kanji, then you should already know this!",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8D%83
101,上る,TO CLIMB,"上る consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, so it will use the kun'yomi reading of the kanji. For 上, there are multiple kun'yomi readings, and you didn't learn this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
You want to climb the mountain, but a gruff old man grabs your shoulder and says ""No boy, you ain't climbing that thing, not today."" If you're not a boy, think about how weird it is that he called you a boy. If you are a grown man, think how you wish he called you ""dude"" or something, not ""boy."" If you're a boy, well... think about how appropriate it is that he said ""no boy.""","This word means to climb. You can tell this word is a verb because it ends with an う sound (る, in this case). Its meaning is similar to the meaning of the 上 kanji, which is ""above."" So this word is all about moving ""above"" something (in other words, climbing!)",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8A%E3%82%8B
102,正す,TO CORRECT,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
After you correct something for someone, you yell out ta da (ただ) very excitedly. Go ahead and imagine yourself doing this a few times to help you to remember.","This word is made up of a kanji with some hiragana attached, ending in an う sound. That means this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ""correct,"" so what is the verb form of that? It would be to correct.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%AD%A3%E3%81%99
103,出る,TO EXIT,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
You want to exit the room you're in. Why? Because it has a dead (で) body in it. Seriously. You should exit now. It's a dead (で) room (る)!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ""exit"" so what is the verb form of this? It is to exit.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%87%BA%E3%82%8B
104,立つ,TO STAND,"You have to remember the た portion of this word to learn the reading of it. Think of it this way:
You have to stand up in order to wave goodbye to someone. When you stand up, you also say ta ta (た)!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means ""stand"" so what is the verb version of that? It's to stand.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%AB%8B%E3%81%A4
105,木,TREE,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
You walk up to the tree. You have to get inside, because it takes you someplace secret. So, you take out your key (き) and put it in the slot, opening the door in the tree so you can slip inside.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%9C%A8
106,水中,UNDERWATER,This is a jukugo word that uses the on'yomi readings of the kanji. You should be able to read this on your own.,"If you're in the middle of a bunch of water, then you're most likely underwater.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%B0%B4%E4%B8%AD
107,下手,UNSKILLFUL,"If you're bad at something and you complain about it, then you're just a hater (へた). Don't be a hater.","Think of someone holding out their hand at shoulder level. Anything above that equals ""skillful."" Everything below that equals ""unskillful. So, in the case of this word, ""below hand"" means ""unskillful.""",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%8B%E6%89%8B
108,中々,VERY,"The reading for this word is the kun'yomi reading, since it's like putting two single kanji together rather than a true jukugo word. To learn the kun'yomi reading, take a look at this mnemonic:
From the middle of the middle comes a sound. It is a knocking sound. Knock. Knock. Knock. You open up the walls around this thing. Then you open up the second set of walls (middle of the middle). Inside is an old man, who identifies himself as ""the knocker."" You go inside of him and find another knocker as well. That's why it's a knocker knocker (なかなか).","The 々 symbol just repeats the kanji that comes before it. You'll see it from time to time, so take note of it, even though it doesn't really have any meaning of its own. So, essentially 中々 is the same as 中中. That being said, you have something that's middle x2. When something is even more middle than middle itself, it is very or considerably something or another.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%AD%E3%80%85
109,火山,VOLCANO,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well. The 山 reading is ざん instead of さん because of rendaku (sequential voicing).",A fire mountain is probably what you think it is: A volcano.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%81%AB%E5%B1%B1
110,水,WATER,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
Be sure you always carry water when visiting the me zoo (みず). That's a zoo with rows and rows of cages of... me. And I'm thirsty!",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%B0%B4
111,白,WHITE,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
White surrounds you. The sheer (しろ) amount of white is overwhelming.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%99%BD
112,白人,WHITE PERSON,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Imagine a white person you know well wearing their favorite pair of hacked up jeans (はくじん). This person likes to wear jeans with as many rips and holes in them as possible. Now imagine them wearing only their hacked up jeans. What a sight!","This word uses white and person ... put those together and you have a white person, aka a caucasian person.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%99%BD%E4%BA%BA
113,文,WRITING,"This word uses one of the readings you learned for the kanji: ぶん. You can remember this by thinking how whenever you're working on your writing, you get hungry and want to eat a bun.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%96%87
114,〜才,YEARS OLD,"The reading is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it! Don't try to type the 〜 part though.","Although this word consists of one kanji that is all alone, it doesn't share its meaning with the parent kanji. The meanings are similar in a way, though. This word means years old or age. With more years comes more genius, right? That's why this word means ""years old"" and not ""genius,"" like the parent kanji.
You can stick this word onto numbers to say how old someone is!
Special note for all of you advanced learners out there. When discussing age, 〜歳 is the original and correct kanji to use. Because 〜才 is easier to write and has the same reading, it became mainstream. You'll see it used in writing today, especially in elementary schools. In formal writing though, you'll always want to use 〜歳, which you'll learn later on.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%80%9C%E6%89%8D
115,少し,A LITTLE,"Did you know that this word created an English word you probably already know? Have you ever heard someone say ""just a skosh""? That's 少し! Hopefully you know this English word and therefore know this Japanese word as well.","This word is a single kanji with hiragana attached, though there is no specific clue as to what type of word it is. That means you can usually guess it's a noun, adverb or na-adjective (in this case it's a noun / adverb). The meaning of this word is pretty much the same as the kanji, though, making it fairly easy. The kanji meaning for 少 is few, and the meaning of the vocab form is a little or a few.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B0%91%E3%81%97
116,アメリカ人,AMERICAN,"Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.
And since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Americans absolutely love their jeans (じん), it's a well-known fact!","The アメリカ part is pretty easy so long as you know katakana. It's the word for ""America."" You know that 人 means ""person,"" so you can figure out that America + Person = American.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%82%A2%E3%83%A1%E3%83%AA%E3%82%AB%E4%BA%BA

118,〜台,BIG MACHINE COUNTER,The reading is the same as the one you learned with the kanji. Be sure to omit the 〜 in your answer as it is only a placeholder for a number.,"This counter is used with some kind of machine or device, usually a fairly large one (so nothing itty bitty). Cars are a good example of this. But it can also be used for things like computers, which were once the size of rooms, but are now nice and small. Thanks technology!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%80%9C%E5%8F%B0
119,イギリス人,BRITISH PERSON,"Often times, when two kanji come together to form a kanji compound (or jukugo), you use the on'yomi readings. This is similar to that, though instead of another kanji it's a foreign word. This pattern works with almost any country as well. Just add 人 to a country name and you've described the people who live there. You'll see more of these before you're finished here.
And since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
As with all words for nationalities, the 人 here is pronounced じん. All nationalities, including Brits, love jeans (じん)!","イギリス means ""Great Britain"" or ""United Kingdom."" So what is a ""Great Britain person?"" You guessed it — a British person, or Brit.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AE%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E4%BA%BA

121,牛,COW,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:
You're leading the cows around the field. To get them to move, you yell out ""USH, USH, USH!"" (うし) because you have a speech impediment and want to say ""MUSH MUSH MUSH."" Go ahead and say this out loud, yelling it if you can.","The kanji and the word are the same. This word is a bit broader than cow though, and can also be used to be bull and ox.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%89%9B
122,戸口,DOORWAY,"The reading for this one is mixed. You get the kun'yomi readings for both kanji, even though it's a combo (jukugo) kanji. Since 戸's only reading is the kun'yomi reading you should know it. Also, you should know the kun'yomi reading for 口 as well from level 1. That means as long as you remember that this is a kun'yomi fest over here, you should be able to read this word. Also watch out for the rendaku (also known as sequential voicing). That just means the く becomes the voiced ぐ.","Do you remember the words 出口 (exit) and 入り口 (entrance) from previous levels? The 口 can be a doorway of some kind. This word is literally ""door mouth"" but I bet you can figure out that this actually means doorway.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%88%B8%E5%8F%A3
123,山びこ,ECHO,You learned this kanji reading when you learned the vocabulary 山.,"You know that 山 means mountain. Add the hiragana びこ to the end and this gives you echo. That's because bee children (bee 子) love echos, especially mountain echos! Imagine baby bees buzzing as loudly as they can and hearing their voices echoing back at them through the mountains.
As the kanji suggests, 山びこ is generally used to describe the echo you get if you shout in the mountains. To decribe other types of echo, you can use the katakana word エコー.
By the way, there is actually a kanji for the second part of this word, but it's so rare that it's usually written in kana!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B1%B1%E3%81%B3%E3%81%93
124,外れ,EXTREMITY,"Let's continue the previous story: You're off in the extremity of space and your friend is running low on Vitamin D. He has (はず) to get some sun れs on his skin! How's that supposed to happen with those spacesuits on, though?","The kanji 外 alone means ""outside."" This word means extremity. How can you remember this? Just think of the れ as a ""ray of sunshine."" Where you are, in the extremity of space, even the れs of the sun cannot be seen. So, when 外 is combined with れ just think of this.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%96%E3%82%8C
125,太い,FAT,"This is the kun'yomi reading of the kanji (because it's a single kanji, all alone with hiragana attached). The part you have to remember is the ふと portion. Let's use a mnemonic.
The fat guy looked down and couldn't see his foot (ふと).","This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of the fat? It's the same: fat.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%AA%E3%81%84
126,父,FATHER,The reading for this word is the same as the one you learned when learning the kanji.,"The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of father. You use this when you're talking about your own father to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%88%B6
127,お父さん,FATHER,"The part you have to learn to read is the 父 portion. This uses the kun'yomi, which you didn't learn when doing the kanji.
Imagine you are taking your venerable father to とうきょう. He's always wanted to go and this is the trip of a lifetime! Imagine walking through the streets of Tokyo with your Dad, taking in all the sights.","This word begins with an honorific (お), making whatever comes after it more elevated. Then there's 父, which you know means father. Lastly, we have the honorific name ender さん. So this is a nice way to say father. You use it when you're talking to your own dad or talking about him with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' dads.
In more formal settings, you'll want to use 父 (pronounced ちち) to talk about your own dad and お父様 to talk about someone else's dad. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おとうさま.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%81%8A%E7%88%B6%E3%81%95%E3%82%93
128,少ない,FEW,"The reading for this one is fairly difficult, as it's the kun'yomi reading (you can tell it's kun'yomi because of all the hiragana attached). You have to remember the すく part to remember the reading of this word. Think of it this way:
You have a few of something. This something is suckers (すく). Imagine putting all (three-ish) of them in your mouth at once. How does it taste? Can you taste the flavors from each of the few?","This word has a single kanji with hiragana attached, ending in a い. This means you know it's an adjective. What is the adjective form of few?

Who's the foreigner? Well obviously the guy wearing jeans (がいじん)!","An ""outside person"" is a foreigner. This word is fairly common, though it's not super polite, either. It's okay most of the time, but it can be used derogatorily depending on the situation. The more polite version is 外国人 (outside country person) but you won't learn that until you learn the kanji for 国.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%96%E4%BA%BA

132,生,FRESH,"This uses one of the kun'yomi readings. Here's a mnemonic to help you remember it:
After eating raw fish, my yoga teacher and I say namaste (なま) to the sushi chef, bowing low to show our appreciation.","Normally a single kanji alone like this would mean the same thing as its parent kanji, but in the case of 生 it's a little different (but still related). When you think of something that has life, it's fresh or raw. Think sashimi or sushi, for example. You want that to be as close as possible to life as you can, so you eat it when it's fresh and raw. This word can also be used to describe a live event, like a concert or sporting event.
You'll see this word at the beginning of other words. For example, 生たまご is ""raw egg.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%94%9F

Just watch out for the rendaku.","When you see a katakana word, it's a safe bet that it is a foreign loan word from somewhere else. This one's interesting, because it combines katakana and kanji! The first marble came to Japan from Portugal, so the ビー part of the word is short for ""vidro,"" which means ""glass"" in Portuguese. Anyway, don't get thrown off by that ビー. Maybe just imagine that your favorite marble is black and yellow like a bee.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%83%93%E3%83%BC%E7%8E%89
144,お母さん,MOTHER,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it uses the kun'yomi reading. You have to remember the かあ portion. Here's a mnemonic to help you to remember it:
What does your super nice mother do for you (this is why you're so polite to her!)? She drives you all around in her car (かあ) taking you wherever you need to go... soccer, kendo, whatever. What a nice mother you have!","This word starts with お which makes it more polite. Then, there's the kanji 母 which you know means mother. Last, there's the honorific さん which further adds respect (to the mother). So, this is the nice way to say mother. You use it when you're talking to your own mom or talking about her with friends. You can also use this when you're talking about your friends' moms.
If you need to talk about someone's mother that you don't really know, or you aren't close to, you'll want to use お母様, instead. Don't worry, you'll learn that last kanji in a few lessons. Until then, it's pronounced, おかあさま. Kay?",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%81%8A%E6%AF%8D%E3%81%95%E3%82%93
145,母,MOTHER,"The reading is the kun'yomi reading, but this is the reading you learned with the kanji. Just remember, your mother is a terrible person and won't stop laughing at you: ""HA HA HA HA HA!""","The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. This is the polite and humble form of mother. You use this when you're talking about your own mother to other people, especially if you aren't very close to them.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%AF%8D
146,市立,MUNICIPAL,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.","The city stand is municipal in nature. Municipal means ""of or relating to a city or its governing body"", and this vocabulary means just that. Or just city. City is fine too.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%B8%82%E7%AB%8B
147,北,NORTH,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
You're going to the far north where it's very cold (north pole, perhaps?). One of the most important things you bring with you is a survival kit (きた).",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8C%97
148,今,NOW,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
What'll you drink now? I'll have a Zima, ima.
Say ""ZIMA IMA"" ten times fast.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BB%8A
149,〜人,NUMBER OF PEOPLE,"This is a counter, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 has two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you remember which one to use:
Just think of the sheer number of people at Nintendo (にん). It must be huge. This really is just a counter for people that work at Nintendo.","When you see this on a number, for example ７人 or ３人, you're using it to count people. Just remember, both 一人 and 二人 have alternative readings. From 3 and up it's just the number plus にん, like this. ５人 is ごにん, １０人 is じゅうにん, etc. This is the counter for people, which makes this word the number of people.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%80%9C%E4%BA%BA
150,大人しい,OBEDIENT,You already learned this reading when you learned 大人! You should be able to read this too!,"Remember how you learned that 大人 means ""adult?"" Well this is the adjective version of that. The I-adjective (see how it ends in い?). What adjective do adults want to be able to use for their own kids? They want to say they are obedient, quiet kids!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%A7%E4%BA%BA%E3%81%97%E3%81%84
151,古い,OLD,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji with some hiragana attached, it's going to use the kun'yomi reading. You learned the on'yomi when learning the kanji portion, so let's use a mnemonic to help you with the reading of this word:
If you're old, you're also full (ふる) of memories. And you're probably full of old secrets. And you're full from old people food.","This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of old? It's also old, ancient, or out-of-date.
This word is used for things like clothes, food and friendships, but not for people! So a 古い友人 (old friend) is someone you've been friends with for a long time, not an elderly friend.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%8F%A4%E3%81%84

154,人生,ONE'S LIFE,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. Since 人 and 生 both have two on'yomi readings, here's a mnemonic to help you:
Your life boils down to just two things: jeans and a saber (じんせい). Your whole life, that's all you've ever needed, jeans and a saber. What are you, some kind of American pirate?",The kanji for person and life combined makes you think about human life. What is your human life like?,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%BA%E7%94%9F
155,テーブルの上,ON THE TABLE,"In this phrase, 上 is a standalone word, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary. Easy to stay on top of that one, right?","First we have a katakana word, so it's safe to assume that it's a loan word. Like many loan words, it comes from English. Say it out loud and what do you have? That's right, ""table"". Then comes the particle の, which joins two nouns together. Finally we have 上, which you learned means ""up"" or ""above"". Put all of these pieces together and we have a phrase meaning on the table or tabletop!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%83%86%E3%83%BC%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%8A
156,元,ORIGIN,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
You're trying to trace a person back to their origin so you can learn more about them. You finally get there - it's a castle. The problem is that it's surrounded by a huge moat (もと) and you can't get past it because the drawbridge is up. Feel the frustration of this. Think about your goal and how close you are to getting to it if it wasn't for this lousy moat.","The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well. When it's used as a prefix, it takes on the related meaning of ex- or former.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%85%83
157,外,OUTSIDE,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading. When learning the kanji, you didn't learn that reading, so here's a mnemonic to help you with this word:
You look outside, it's totally frozen. You throw salt (そと) outside to melt the ice.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%96
158,分,PART,"This word is usually combined with other words, which is probably why this single kanji vocab word uses the on'yomi instead of the kun'yomi. If you know the kanji reading, you know this vocab's reading as well, but the reading is different depending on the meaning:
If it means part or portion, it's read ぶん. Probably because your buns come in two parts. Ohoho.","This word has the same meaning that you learned with the kanji: part, or portion. By extension, it can also mean content, as in ""alcohol content"" because that's the portion of alcohol in a drink.
This word is used for fractions, too, as in one third or one quarter. Again, you can see how this links to ""parts"" and ""portions"", right?",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%86
159,シアトル市,SEATTLE,"This word uses on'yomi reading, which you learned with the kanji.","The name of the city (シアトル／しあとる) with a 市 attached to it means it is ""the city of ____."" You can do this with any city (try it out on your hometown!). So this word means Seattle, or more specifically City of Seattle.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%82%B7%E3%82%A2%E3%83%88%E3%83%AB%E5%B8%82
160,中古,SECONDHAND,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.","The combination of kanji doesn't make perfect sense, but it's alright. Take something that's middle old and you have something that's used or secondhand. It's not 100% old yet... it's still in the middle, meaning you can give it to someone else to use, like your younger siblings.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%AD%E5%8F%A4

163,十台,TEN MACHINES,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji.

164,万,TEN THOUSAND,"When a vocab word is a single kanji with no okurigana, it usually uses the kun'yomi reading. Numbers are an exception to this. Numbers use the on'yomi reading, which you've already learned by learning the kanji's reading! How nice!",When a vocab word is a single kanji without okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) it usually has the same meaning as the kanji it's spawned from. If you know the kanji meaning you'll also know the vocab meaning. It's ten thousand!,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%87
165,一万,TEN THOUSAND,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.","When you have one ten thousand you just have ten thousand. In Japanese, though, you specify how many ten thousands you have, though (which is weird in English, but should make sense if you think about it).",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%87

167,生まれる,TO BE BORN,"You have to remember the う part of this word to read it. To remember that, let's use a mnemonic:
Just imagine someone being born. All they do is scream: UUUUUuuUuuUUUuuuUUUuu (う) the whole time. Go ahead and imagine yourself being born and doing the same thing. Say UUUuuUUuuu out loud to help you to remember.","Since this is a kanji with hiragana attached that ends with an う sound, you know that this word is a verb. What's the ultimate verb version of the kanji 生? That would be to be born, the very beginning of life as we know it!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%94%9F%E3%81%BE%E3%82%8C%E3%82%8B
168,切る,TO CUT,"When you think to cut something, what do you think about cutting? One thing is cutting down a tree, which is also known as 木, or き. You きる a き.","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means cut, and the verb form of that is to cut.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%87%E3%82%8B
169,今日,TODAY,"The reading for this word is a complete exception, though the word itself is incredibly common and useful. When you think of ""today"" think about what you have to do today for work.
You have to work in one of those mall kiosks (きょう). Just think about how sad you are that you have to do this today. What a crummy day. It's sunny outside and you're stuck in a mall manning this hermit crab kiosk.
Note: This reading mnemonic is pretty far away from the actual reading, as far as reading mnemonics go. Use this to get yourself close, and then use your own brain grapes to get the rest of the way there. This one won't be as easy as most of the others, but do some good old fashioned memorization and you should be okay. I won't ask you to do this much, fortunately. :)","The now day is what day? Oh, it's today.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BB%8A%E6%97%A5
170,外す,TO DISCONNECT SOMETHING,"Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be a kun'yomi reading. You haven't learned this one yet, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
If you're going to disconnect something, it has (はず) to be the right thing! Don't go disconnecting the wrong plug, you'll cause no end of trouble!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.
The kanji 外 means outside, and the meaning of this verb is somewhat related. It means to disconnect something. Think of it like this, if you disconnect a plug from a socket, you are taking the plug ""outside"" of the socket, right? Depending on the context, this verb can also mean to miss something (like the target during archery practice), to remove something, or to exclude something.
This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You disconnect something, like a plug, or remove something, like your dog's leash. It's worth mentioning that most verbs ending in す are transitive, so you'll start seeing this pattern as you learn more!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%96%E3%81%99
171,太る,TO GET FAT,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You have to learn the ふと portion of this word to be able to read it. Here's a mnemonic to help you:
You're getting fat so quickly that you can see your body expanding. You look down - at first you can see your foot (ふと) but then a second later you can't. You can't see your foot because you're getting fat, even when you stick your foot way out. What's going on?","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means fat so the verb form of that is to get fat.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A4%AA%E3%82%8B
172,引く,TO PULL,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. The reading (ひ) is the same as the one you learned for the kanji, meaning you should already know it!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means pull and the verb version vocab means to pull.
This word has other meanings too! When you pull numbers away from other numbers, what you're really doing is subtracting them. That's why this word also means to subtract. And when you pull something towards you, that's to attract it.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%BC%95%E3%81%8F
173,広げる,TO SPREAD SOMETHING,"Since this word has okurigana (hiragana attached to the kanji) you know that it's probably going to be the kun'yomi reading. You learned this reading with the kanji, but here's a reminder mnemonic to help you:
You are going to spread something. What are you going to spread? How about your arms, so that you can fly into the sky like the super hero (ひろ) that you are! Most heroes can fly when they spread their arms wide!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb.
The kanji itself means wide, and the verb version is what happens when you try to make something wider. How do you make something wider? That's right, you have to spread something, to unfold something or to open something up. All of those actions will make a thing wider!
This is a transitive verb. That means it takes a direct object. You spread something. Like a newspaper, or a cloth on a table.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%BA%83%E3%81%92%E3%82%8B
174,止める,TO STOP SOMETHING,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
You need to stop something from moving. Maybe a car... or a door... or a person... whatever you want. To stop this thing, you throw out your toe (と), getting it smashed in the process. Imagine it bleeding and swelling up. How much it hurts! You put your toe out to stop this big thing, what a mistake!","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means stop and the verb vocab version of that is to stop something.
This particular word is when you're stopping something (i.e. doing the action of stopping it).",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%AD%A2%E3%82%81%E3%82%8B
175,分かる,TO UNDERSTAND,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you:
You scream ""WAHHHHHH"" (わ) in terror and ""CAAAR!!!"" (か) as you careen down the freeway. Your dad is driving like a maniac and almost hit another car! ""WAAH CAAAR!!!"" (わか) you scream again. If only he understood your terror!","This word means to understand, which might surprise you if you remember that the kanji 分 means ""part"" or ""parts."" Think of it this way: to understand something you have to break it down into its parts to see how it works.
Watch out, though, because whereas in English you understand something, in Japanese the thing you understand is the grammatical subject (it's doing the action). So, a more literal meaning for this is to be understandable. In other words, there's no object, and 分かる is intransitive, meaning it happens on its own. The かる ending is a hint, because verbs with かる as okurigana (kana added to the kanji) are usually intransitive.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%88%86%E3%81%8B%E3%82%8B
176,用いる,TO UTILIZE,"Since this word consists of a kanji with hiragana attached, you can bet that it will use the kun'yomi reading. You didn't learn that reading with this kanji, so here's a mnemonic to help you to learn the もち portion of もちいる:
What will you utilize to get the job done? You have mochi (もち) in your hand, so you'll use that. Now go think of some kind of imaginary task you'll complete with mochi, making it as ridiculous as possible.","This word consists of kanji with hiragana attached. Because the hiragana ends with an う sound, you know this word is a verb. The kanji itself means task or use. You can think of this verb as a more formal way to say to use, and that is to utilize.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E7%94%A8%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B
177,二万,TWENTY THOUSAND,"This is a jukugo word, which usually means on'yomi readings from the kanji. If you know the readings of your kanji you'll know how to read this as well.","When you have two ten thousands, you have twenty thousand.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E4%BA%8C%E4%B8%87

179,ベッドの下,UNDER THE BED,"下 is a standalone word here, so it uses the same reading that you learned when you learned the vocabulary.","This starts with another katakana word, so you can assume that it's a loan word. This one also comes from English. Can you figure out what it means? That's right, ""bed"". Then comes the particle の, which joins two nouns together. Finally, we have 下, which you learned means ""down"" or ""below"". Put these elements together and you get below the bed, under the bed or beneath the bed. What's under your bed?",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E3%83%99%E3%83%83%E3%83%89%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%8B
180,方,WAY,"Since this word is made up of a single kanji, it should use the kun'yomi reading, but it can be either that or the on'yomi reading, depending on the context. You haven't learned the kun'yomi reading for 方 yet, so there's a mnemonic to help you:
You need to go a certain direction. How do you get there? By jumping into a catapult (かた) and shooting yourself the right way. Need to get a particular direction fast? Consider the catapult next time.",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E6%96%B9
181,広い,WIDE,"The reading for this word is the same as the reading you learned in the kanji section: ひろ, making this ひろい.","This is a single kanji with an い on the end, meaning you know it's probably an adjective. What's the adjective form of wide? It's also wide.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%BA%83%E3%81%84
182,冬,WINTER,"The reading for this word is the same as the kun'yomi reading you learned for the kanji, meaning you should know both!",The kanji and the word are exactly the same. That means they share meanings as well.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%86%AC
183,女の人,WOMAN,"This word is actually two separate words combined with a particle. So, since you treat them like separate words, you read each of them with the kun'yomi readings (they are both single kanji words all alone). That being said, in level 1 you learned about the vocab readings for these separate words, so use that knowledge to remember the reading for this word as well.","The の particle makes it so the 人 belongs to the 女. Basically, this literally means ""a woman person"" or ""a person of woman."" It's a more polite way to say plain old woman, though, so all you have to remember is that.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/vocabulary/%E5%A5%B3%E3%81%AE%E4%BA%BA
