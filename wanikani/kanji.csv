0,上,ABOVE,"Of course when you find a toe above the ground, you want to know where the toe came from. When you examine it, you see a name written on there. This toe belongs to the local clumsy farmhand, Jourm (じょう).
HINTS
Try to remember Jourm, the local farmhand. He is a recurring character that will come up anytime the reading for a kanji is じょう.
He is a very big man, and he wears farmer's clothes. It's important to imagine your version of Jourm as very big, because it will help us to differentiate him from Jo-Anne, who is the character associated with the similar, but shorter reading (and character) じょ. Although Jourm will develop as you go through all the じょう reading kanji, for now just imagine him as a big, kinda slow dude who works for a local farmer. Also, he only has nine or fewer toes, apparently.","You find a toe on the ground. It's weird, because it's above the ground, not where toes belong.
HINTS
Focus your imagination on how body parts should be buried, not above ground like this. Sure, finding a toe is a little strange, but finding a toe above the ground? Downright silly.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%8A
1,下,BELOW,"You keep digging for the toe below the ground, and instead of hitting a toe you hit something hard and metallic. You keep digging and digging around it, but it's huge. Turns out, you found yourself a car (か). Keep digging until you unearth the car. Inside, you find the toe you were looking for.
HINTS
There's another useful on'yomi reading that just isn't useful enough for you to learn now. That reading is げ, but we're only going to worry about that much, much later when you have to learn one or two vocab words that read 下 as げ. That's the problem with really common kanji - too many readings.","There's a toe below ground.
HINTS
So, where is the toe now? It's below ground. Imagine yourself digging it out, and thinking... ugh, why does it have to be below ground like this? So irritating. Will I be able to sew it back on in time to save it?",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%8B
2,大,BIG,"There's this big guy (that's how you remember the radical, remember?), and he's wearing a huge Tie Dye (たい, だい) shirt. Because he's so huge, the tie dye shirt is also super huge. Everything about him is pretty big, but the tie dye stands out more than anything.
HINTS
When you look at the big guy in your head, imagine him covered in tie dye head to toe. Think about how ridiculous it looks on him, especially since he's such a big guy. Shirt. Sweatpants. Hat. Shoes... it goes on and on.","The big radical and the big kanji are exactly the same!
HINTS
So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of this kanji as well.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%A4%A7
3,工,CONSTRUCTION,"For kanji that use the こう (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character こういち every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see こう, think こういち.
You see some construction in front of you. There, standing shirtless (only a suspender and hard hat) is (こういち), looking back at you.
HINTS
If こういち as a construction worker standing in a construction site some how doesn't make your legs tremble, that's okay and totally normal. Do make sure you take this story to a ridiculous enough level to hook a memory into that brain of yours. Be mad at him for not following construction site regulations (where's his shirt, shoes, and pants!?). Why is he using that bulldozer like that?
Alternatively, say you really do like what you see (you're going to have to imagine a much better looking version of こういち's actual face, though). You and こういち make eye contact a little too long. He nods, puts his cigarette out, and takes off his hard hat, letting his long Fabio-esque locks flow. You beckon him over and he comes. What happens next is up to you and your own imagination. My guess is you have a very deep conversation about kanji and the best ways to learn it.
Hint: When you see 工 in a kanji it will often take the こう reading. Remember that, because it comes up quite a bit!","The construction radical and the construction kanji are the same!
This kanji also means industry, which is what construction is, if you think about it. It's all part of the construction industry.
HINTS
Know your radicals and you'll know this kanji's meaning.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%B7%A5
4,八,EIGHT,"After you count and smell all eight of your fins, it's time to put them away. You open a large hatch (はち) and put them in. This is where you keep your fins, always putting in eight at a time because that's what the boss wants.
HINTS
You've asked him why you can only put eight fins at a time in the hatch, but he never wants to answer. What could be down in the hole that the hatch covers? Why is there a hatch at all? What's with numbers and hatches being mysterious?","This isn't exactly the same as the fins radical, but it's close. Sometimes this will happen (where we have to use a slightly ""modified radical"" version of the original), so it's good to understand that now, early on. In this case, we have fins. How many fins? Eight fins. How do you know that? Because you caught four fish with two fins each.
HINTS
Count the fins out in front of you, all the way from one to eight. It'll help if you actually do this. Now smell each fin, and think ""Wow, I have to smell all eight of these?"" Yes, you do.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%85%AB
5,入,ENTER,"Turns out, after you enter the teepee (you'll remember that the radical is a teepee with a big entrance to it), you're given a new (にゅう) one! Now you have two teepees!
HINTS
Imagine lights turning on and flashing, and an entire audience inside. You're at a gameshow, and the announcer announces the neeeeew teepee in his announcey voice. Feel the surprise. Feel the happiness. Feel the excitement. A beautiful new teepee all for you!","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for enter first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means enter as well.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%85%A5
6,山,MOUNTAIN,"Think about mountains talking to each other, calling each other by their names and adding the Japanese name-ender san (さん) to each of their names. ""Hello, Everest-san."" ""Oh hi, Fuji-san.""
HINTS
Be sure to imagine this vividly. The more absurdly you can imagine it, the more likely you are to remember the reading, san.","The mountain radical and the mountain kanji are the same.
HINTS
Make sure you're studying your radicals. If you are, then you're studying your kanji as well!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%B1%B1
7,口,MOUTH,"Do you remember seeing the construction worker こういち earlier in the 工 mnemonic? If you haven't yet, not to worry!
For kanji with こう readings (there are a lot of them!) we will use the character こういち every time. He's one of the people who started this website, so we'll do our best in the mnemonics to embarrass him as much as possible. Anyways, remember that whenever you see こう, think こういち.
Everyone agrees, (こういち)'s mouth is his best feature. You stare at it lovingly as he whispers sweet kanji readings to you.
HINTS
You just can't forget all the cool things about kanji learning he said from that mouth. What a great mouth こういち has. How are the lips of his mouth both so skinny and fat at the same time?","The mouth radical and the mouth kanji are exactly the same!
HINTS
If you learned your radicals–which the WaniKani system forces you to do (unless you're cheating)–you'll already know the meaning of the kanji.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8F%A3
8,九,NINE,"Although this kanji has two on'yomi to learn, the pronunciations of those two on'yomi are very similar, so that should make them easier to remember.
When you were nine your favorite foods were cookies (く) and cucumbers (きゅう). Yum yum!
HINTS
Picture nine-year-old you, lining up nine cookies and nine cucumbers. You dip a cookie in milk and bite into it, then dip a cucumber in and take a bite. Nine bites each until they're all gone. Ah, you miss being nine.","Nice! This kanji is the same as the radical that looks just like it (down to the meaning, even!). The radical is nine and the kanji is nine, making the meaning of this kanji really easy to remember as long as you know the radical first.
HINTS
If you know your radicals well, this kanji will be a breeze!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B9%9D
9,一,ONE,"As you're sitting there next to One, holding him up, you start feeling a weird sensation all over your skin. From the wound comes a fine powder (obviously coming from the special bullet used to kill One) that causes the person it touches to get extremely itchy (いち).
HINTS
Make sure you feel the ridiculously itchy sensation covering your body. It climbs from your hands, where you're holding the number One up, and then goes through your arms, crawls up your neck, goes down your body, and then covers everything. It becomes uncontrollable, and you're scratching everywhere, writhing on the ground. It's so itchy that it's the most painful thing you've ever experienced (you should imagine this vividly, so you remember the reading of this kanji).","Lying on the ground is something that looks just like the ground, the number One. Why is this One lying down? It's been shot by the number two. It's lying there, bleeding out and dying. The number One doesn't have long to live.
HINTS
To remember the meaning of One, imagine yourself there at the scene of the crime. You grab One in your arms, trying to prop it up, trying to hear its last words. Instead, it just splatters some blood on your face. ""Who did this to you?"" you ask. The number One points weakly, and you see number Two running off into an alleyway. He's always been jealous of number One and knows he can be number one now that he's taken the real number one out.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%80
10,人,PERSON,"Only one person at Nintendo (にん) complained about the new jeans (じん) policy, and that person was you.
HINTS
Imagine how angry you were about the policy. You'll have to come up with something to be angry about yourself (pick something that would actually make you angry, like maybe you're only allowed to wear cut off short-shorts jeans at Nintendo now), but if you pick something good, you'll definitely remember the two readings for this. Just remember you're working at Nintendo, and the policy has to be something about jeans. Then, imagine yourself as the only person complaining and everyone else in their dumb jeans (or lack-thereof) shaking their head at you because you're being a fool.","Remember how the radical version of this kanji meant person because it's a person walking from the side with their arms down? Well this is a person too!
HINTS
Know the radicals, and you shall know the kanji.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%BA%BA
11,力,POWER,"Who has the most power of anyone? It's the Power Rangers. They are battling their arch enemy Ricky (りき). They defeat him and lock (りょく) him up, so that he can't hurt anyone ever again.
HINTS
Know anyone named Ricky (りき), even a famous person like Ricky Ricardo or Ricky Gervais? Imagine that person's face on the monster the Power Rangers are fighting. Now, imagine the Power Rangers locking (りょく) him up. He looks much less scary once he's locked up. Phew.","The radical and the meaning of this kanji are the same. Both are power.
HINTS
If you know the radicals, you should be feeling fine... No, you should feel powerful!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8A%9B
12,川,RIVER,"You're standing next to a river that's actually used as a car wash (かわ).
HINTS
Imagine standing by the river, watching all those cars floating by. They start off really dirty, but the river washes them all clean.","The river radical and the river kanji are the same as each other!
HINTS
So, if you know the radical you know the kanji as well.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%B7%9D
13,七,SEVEN,"You know this kanji means Seven, so let's use that to remember the reading too. Seven is a lucky number, usually, but this time it wasn't so good.
Seven percent is all she got on her test after she cheated (しち) on it.
HINTS
How unbelievable is it that someone got seven percent on a test, especially if you try to cheat? Imagine the girl you loathe the most from school, and imagine her cheating on the test (it's important it's a girl, because of the ""she"" part in she cheated (しち). Then, imagine your happiness when she's super upset about getting seven percent on it. Serves her right, obviously.","Lucky for you (as is the case with many of the lower-stroke kanji), this kanji is the same as the radical you've already learned. The radical that makes up this kanji is seven and the kanji (which is exactly the same) is also seven. So, if you know the radical, you know the meaning of the kanji as well.
HINTS
Make sure you know your radicals well and you'll be A-Okay on this one!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%83
14,十,TEN,"This cross in particular has ten jewels (じゅう) on it. Two on each arm and two in the middle. That's ten jewels!
HINTS
Picture the jewels on this cross. Maybe draw it out on a piece of paper so the visual really sticks. Each cross is really a symbol for different sets of ten things, and in this case, it's ten jewels.","This cross is the symbol for the number ten. A good way to remember this is to think about all the religions that have crosses and also important sets of tens.
HINTS
If you're familiar with Christianity, they have a cross and ten commandments. Cross = ten, you see?",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8D%81
15,三,THREE,"Three is the number of chances you get with Santa-san (さん). He has a list, and when you get to three ""naughty things"" lines, that's it. You're on Santa-san's three strikes and you're out list.
HINTS
Picture Santa-san sitting at his desk at the North Pole, eating cookies, and marking one, two, then finally three lines next to names. Once the third line appears, the kid doesn't get presents anymore.","This kanji is made up of the ground radical (which also happens to be the kanji for ""one"") and the radical for two. Combine one and two together and what do you get? Three!
HINTS
This one should be pretty self explanatory! Even easier, you can look at this kanji and see it has three straight lines. You know what one looks like. You know what two looks like. So... this is three!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%89
16,二,TWO,"Think of all the things you have Two of. What is the most important? Some would say eyes, some would say ears. I would say the knee (に) because if you didn't have them, it'd be really hard to go up stairs.
HINTS
Imagine yourself without two knees, and see what it would be like. What would give you trouble? What couldn't you do? Just imagining this for a minute or two will help you to remember the reading of this kanji more effectively.","The kanji two and the radical two are the exact same things. Therefore, you know the kanji for two already!
HINTS
More simply put, you can just know that this kanji is the double of One. It's two lines, that's not all that hard to remember!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%BA%8C
17,女,WOMAN,"When you think of a woman, think of Jo-Anne (じょ), though she usually goes by just ""Jo.""
HINTS
Whenever the reading じょ comes up, we will use the character Jo-Anne. She's quite a short woman, which is to help us differentiate じょ from じょう (who is the giant, oafish farmhand Jourm). じょ is a smaller lady, じょう is a giant man.","The radical for woman and the kanji for woman are exactly the same.
HINTS
That means if you know your radicals well, you know the meaning of this kanji as well! How swell.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%A5%B3
18,玉,BALL,"Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (たま).
HINTS
So, who's in a ball? Which ""Tom"" did you choose?","The king has something in his hand that he's dropping... but it bounces too! He's bouncing a ball
HINTS
This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a ball, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the ball) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%8E%89
19,本,BOOK,"Books are one of the best ways to hone (ほん) your intellect, you know?
HINTS
Just think about books and how you use them to hone your skills. Or read a book about honing things. Like swords.","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for book first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means book as well.
Take note that the second, third, and fourth meanings of this kanji are origin, real, and main. You can figure this out by thinking about how books mainly have their origins in real life.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo! And good luck with all the meanings (sorry sorry sorry).",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%9C%AC
20,子,CHILD,"To remember the sounds し and す we'll use these mnemonics:
There is a child standing in front of you. You look closely at the child but something seems wrong. You rub your eyes and when you open them again there is a sheep (し) in a suit (す) in front of you. You yelp, blink, and it's back to being a child. Are... all children really just sheep in suits?!
HINTS
The child runs away and you chase after it. Every time it's about to turn a corner it looks like a sheep in a suit again, but whenever you yell and point, it turns back. You're the only one who can see this sheep suit child!!","The child radical and the child kanji are exactly the same.
HINTS
So, if you know your radicals, you know your kanji as well! This won't last forever (where radicals are exactly the same as the kanji) so enjoy it while the kanji are still small and simple!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%AD%90
21,丸,CIRCLE,"Do you know about the adorable cat Maru? If not, you should check it out. May seem like a distraction, but if you come back knowing the reading for this kanji, then it's totally worth while.
When you think about a circle, think about Maru all rolled up in a little circle, being super adorable. Don't tell me it doesn't melt your heart just thinking about it.
Alternatively, you could also look at this kanji and think of Maru inside of a box, with his little tail sticking out of it. Whatever works best for you, just get yourself to ""Maru.""
HINTS
Obviously if you ""don't know this reading"" well enough, you should watch some more Maru videos. I'll understand... just make sure you come back someday, okay?","What's something with nine sides? Just add a drop and you'll have something that's almost a circle.
HINTS
It's not quite a circle though. You just need to add a drop of liquid to the edges to smooth it out to become a full circle.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%B8
22,正,CORRECT,"You did the correct thing, so the Shougun (しょう) shows up to reward you! He holds out a shiny new saber (せい) in his hand, gently taps it onto each of your shoulders, and then hands it to you. It's big, curved and you love it.
HINTS
Being correct got the Shougun to notice you AND a new saber. You better make sure to answer this kanji correctly in your reviews too, so you can keep being correct and have more nice things happen.","There is a line on the ground so you stop and a giant sign pops up that says CORRECT! You obeyed the rules of the road and did the correct thing.
HINTS
Imagine walking, staring at the ground until you come across a line that you're supposed to stop at. If you stop, the big ""correct"" sign appears, chiming a happy tune.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%AD%A3
23,土,DIRT,"Who spends a lot of time in dirt? Dogs (ど) do! Dogs dig in dirt, they roll in dirt, sometimes they try to eat dirt (which isn't so great).

Dogs and dirt just go together!","The dirt radical and the dirt kanji are the same!
HINTS
As long as you know the radical dirt, you know the kanji dirt.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%9C%9F
24,犬,DOG,"You see an emu running towards you from off in the distance (strange to see an emu in these parts...). As it gets closer, you realize that it's not an emu at all, it's something that sounds the same, or similar... an inu!
HINTS
There's a good chance you know the word for dog in Japanese already too. If so, you're ahead of the game. If not, do your best to learn the reading before moving on.","The dog radical and dog kanji are exactly the same!
HINTS
Soon there will be very few kanji/radical-same combos ... so enjoy it while you can.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%8A%AC
25,夕,EVENING,"The evening is when all the youths (ゆう) come outside to play.
HINTS
Young people love staying up the entire evening doing youth-people things, and it's really obnoxious for us curmudgeonly folk.
Note: All the ゆう readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat millennials nowadays.","The evening radical and the evening kanji are the same. If you know the radical you know the meaning of the kanji.

Then, you find the exit and run towards it. Sadly, the hunter is waiting there, and he shoots you (しゅつ) through the leg, knocking you down.
HINTS
Focus on the surprise of realizing you're being hunted while trying to find the exit to the mountain range, then focus on the next part, where you get shot. View it in your head as the hunter shooting you. Powww!","There are two mountains in front of you... and probably a bunch more around you too. You are in a pass, and don't know how to get out. You are frantically looking for the exit before you freeze to death. The most important thing is to find the exit from this mountain range - your life depends on it.
HINTS
In your imagination, really feel like your life depends on getting out. The important part is the feeling of ""needing to get out of the mountain pass."" If you have this feeling, you'll be more likely to remember that this kanji means exit, because that's what you want to do when you see this kanji.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%87%BA
27,目,EYE,"Your eyes are important to you, right? Sadly, one of your eyes is missing right now, because a sheep grabbed it and pulled it out, and is now running away from you, yelling his sheep call.... ""Mehhhhhh (め)!""
HINTS
Of course, feel the pain of your eye being gone... and struggle to get it back. You eventually give up because the sheep is too fast, but then you come up with an idea. What if I call out back to the sheep in its own language? Go ahead and cover one eye and start making ""MEHHH"" noises to see if you can get the sheep to come back to you and give you your eye. It's up to you whether it works or not, but be sure to feel frustrated by its reaction, or happy by it. Either one works.","The eye radical and eye kanji are the same as each other, so now you know them both.

Well... you'll know them both as long as you studied your radicals, young grasshopper. If you didn't, then you're just a young grasshopper who needs to study their radicals.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%9B%AE
28,了,FINISH,"How does the fish lure maker test his newly finished lure out? The one he just finished? He gets in a row (りょう) boat and rows out into the sea.
HINTS
Make him think that he can’t just use his new lure on the side of the lake / ocean / whatever. He has to get out there, but unfortunately all he has is a crappy row boat. Imagine the row boat being terrible, leaky, and dangerous, which is why you’re surprised when he goes for it. That’s a terrible row boat to use! If you do this, you'll focus your mind on the rowboat part of things, which will help you to remember the reading of this kanji.","Think about it this way. There is a famous fishing lure inventor, working on his best work ever. He’s old, and he’s been trying to make the best fishing lure for the last 50 years, and knows this will be his last invention. Then he figures it out. He takes one barb, and connects the end of it to the top of another barb. When he does this, he knows his work is finally finished.
HINTS
Make sure you look at this amazing fishing lure too - hold it in your hand, see the two barbs fused together. Think about how strange this lure is. Is this really the best in the world? Will this really finish all other fishing lures?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%BA%86
29,火,FIRE,"Whenever we need to remember か, we use the word car.
For this kanji, when we think fire, we ought to think of something on fire. What's on fire? It's obviously your very own car (か)! Oh Goddd NOOO!
HINTS
Oh no... Oh no!! If you don't have a car, imagine what it'd feel like if your car just exploded and burned down. If you do have a car, imagine your own car in this situation. It should be a terrible feeling, if you imagine it well enough. So, when you think fire, remember the fear you had when your car was given to the flames.

Look at yourself in the mirror and see an adorable four-sided sheep looking back at you. (You can't see the other sides because mirrors aren't 3D and whatnot. So you're a bit cartoonish.)
HINTS
What's better than one four sided sheep?","Imagine contorting yourself in such a way that your legs end up inside your mouth. You have bent your body in all the wrong ways in order to achieve this. In fact, if you look at yourself, you look like a square now... You're just a person with four sides.

Imagine yourself in line to get into heaven. You're super worried, because you're not sure if you'll get in. You heard there was a one in ten chance... those aren't good odds.

36,左,LEFT,"In their left hands, the narwhals all hold saws (さ). That's because the ice for their homes is already there, so they just need to saw away at them to make the shapes they want. Narwhal construction is actually very simple.
HINTS
If you're right-handed, imagine trying to use these left-handed saws. It flips and flops all over until you drop it. But if you're left-handed it feels just right!","Narwhals do construction with their left hands (or flippers, I guess). That's because all narwhals are left-handed!
HINTS
Picture a bunch of narwhals constructing an underwater ice village. They're all working away with their left hands.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%B7%A6
37,中,MIDDLE,"To remember the reading for this kanji, we use the word Chewbacca to pull up ちゅう in our memory.
If you remember back to the radical 中, the middle of your mouth was stabbed with a stick. You look up to see who did it. There stands Chewbacca, doing his Chewbacca yell. And it isn't a stick in your mouth, it's an arrow from his crossbow (a bowcaster, actually). It just so happens Chewbacca's bowcaster looks just like this kanji too. Go figure.
HINTS
Imagine the fear and shock you'd feel after finding out it was Chewbacca who shot the middle of your mouth (and head). Touch his fur. Look really close at his weapon. Give him a sniff, too. Just so that memory never fades away.","The radical Middle and the kanji Middle are both the same. So if you know one, you know the other.
HINTS
Make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise you might find yourself in the middle of a kanji-learning problem.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%AD
38,月,MOON,"Since げつ and がつ are quite similar, we'll use one mnemonic to cover both of them. I expect your experience learning Japanese throughout the future will help you to memorize and differentiate between the two. When the moon goes down and goes away, everyone in the world gets (げつ) up, because that means it's going to be daytime soon!
HINTS
This one might not be as memorable at first, but if you think of the moon, and think about what people do when the moon is up, you'll come to sleeping. Then naturally you can think about what happens when the moon goes down... people gets up!","The moon kanji is made up of the moon radical.
HINTS
This should be EZPZ as long as you know the radicals already!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%9C%88
39,々,REPEATER,"In Japanese, this symbol is often called the のま because it looks like the katakana characters ノ and マ put together. If you know katakana then this will be easy to read. If you don't, think of it this way:
Your mom is the repeater. She is trying to force feed you over and over again until you explode (literally). You keep yelling ""No ma!"" (のま) but she doesn't stop. She's on a repeating track, never stopping, repeating forever.
HINTS
If you feel like you're so full you're about to burst, and if you imagine your mom doing this to you (how could you, ma?), you should be able to remember the reading of this kanji. That being said, the reading is mostly only useful in the event that you have to identify a 々—otherwise, you won't see it much.","This is a strange kanji because it doesn't really mean anything at all. In fact, what it does is it repeats the kanji that comes before it. For example: 人々 is actually 人人. This kanji shows up whenever there's a repeating kanji, because it's often easier to write than writing a more complicated kanji twice. That's why this kanji is the repeater. It repeats what comes before it.
To remember that this kanji is the repeater, though, think of a drop of water dripping into a prison. Drip drop drip drop. It does that over and over again, driving the prisoners nuts. But it never stops. It just repeats over and over.
HINTS
Since this kanji doesn't really have a meaning as much as it does a function, try to change the way you think about it when you're memorizing it.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E3%80%85
40,田,RICE PADDY,"To remember the reading た, we use the word ""taco.""
You're in the rice field... but when you lean down to examine the rice more closely, you see that it's not rice that's growing, it's a bunch of little tacos (た), blossoming out of the ground.
HINTS
Smell the tacos. Touch the tacos. Taste the tacos. This is definitely a very strange rice field.","The rice paddy radical and the rice paddy kanji are the same, making this one super easy to remember, at least meaning-wise.
HINTS
Just know your radicals, and you will know your kanji as well.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%94%B0
41,右,RIGHT,"How did we know to look from the right, though? Because of the youths (ゆう). Youths think in ways that older people usually don't. That's why they can see the swirls on cereal, hear the music behind noise, and of course, look at things from the right side.
HINTS
Imagine a bunch of youths walking in a group and looking at everything from the right. You remember when you were a youth and you used to look at everything from one side too.
Note: All the ゆう readings will use the word ""youths"" for the reading mnemonic. You can think of these ""youths"" as a group of younger people who cause a lot of the problems in this world, just like how people treat Millennials nowadays.","Narwhal mouths are on the right side of their head. In fact, some people didn't think they had mouths at all because they weren't looking from the right. Rookie mistake.
HINTS
Imagine looking at a narwhal from the front. No mouth. Now look at it from the right. Mouth!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8F%B3
42,六,SIX,"Whenever we need to remember the reading ろく we just use the word rock.
So, think about the devil and the devil's number. What is often associated with those things? Why, rock (ろく) and roll is. Imagine the lid-head fin-legged beast suddenly blasting out rock music in the middle of his destructive mayhem.
HINTS
Sing along with the monster, if it helps you to remember the reading of this kanji.","Just imagine a beast with a lid for a head and fins for feet, running around looking as insane as possible (really imagine it!). When it runs up to you, it shows you the top of its lid-head. On it is written the numbers 666. Why? Because it's a spawn of the devil, and the number six is the devil's number.
HINTS
Imagine this beast doing various crazy things, the crazier the better (to help you remember). Make sure all these things are associated with the devil and the devil's number (six), so you can remember the meaning of this kanji.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%85%AD
43,小,SMALL,"This small kanji would be the perfect gift to give to the Shougun (しょう). The Shougun loves little things, and the little kanji represents all of that.

You read that right, shougun is written with a long う sound. Make sure you spell it right from now on!","The small radical and the small kanji are exactly the same.
HINTS
Knowing radicals sure is nice, huh?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%B0%8F
44,立,STAND,"Think of someone who has to stand up straight for you. These people are pros in hospitality. These are the doormen at the Ritz (りつ).
HINTS
Imagine the doormen being extra straight… too straight in their standing. On their uniform is “The Ritz” written in fine lettering, and as you walk past them, they stand up straight and say “Welcome to the Ritz!” Whatever you do, while you’re thinking about it, make sure you think about how they stand up so straight, and associate it with these doormen, who work, specifically, at the Ritz. If you effectively imagine all this, you should be able to remember this on’yomi. Go through it like it’s a movie in your head!","The radical stand and the kanji stand are the same thing, so now you know them both.
HINTS
If you're keeping up with your radical studies, you're also keeping up with your kanji studies!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%AB%8B
45,丁,STREET,"So you're walking down this street, and off in the distance you see the silhouette of somebody. A lady. Big, black curly hair and red eyes. It is the street-woman, Mrs. Chou (ちょう).
HINTS
Mrs. Chou is a character you'll see a lot throughout WaniKani, anytime the reading is ちょう like this one. A lore will develop around her, so the more vividly you can imagine your Mrs. Chou right now, the easier things will get later. In general, she's a mean, evil woman, so as long as you imagine her within those parameters, you're good. And, when I say she is a ""street-woman"" in the mnemonic, I don't mean she is homeless. She has a nice, middle-class home that's not outside of her financial means. What I'm saying is she wanders the streets looking for evil things to do. These are HER streets. So whenever you see the street radical, know that Mrs. Chou is probably going to show up!","The kanji and the radical that look like this are exactly the same. They are both street.
HINTS
As long as you know the radical street, you know the kanji street.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%81
46,日,SUN,"There are so many on'yomi for this kanji, but since this kanji is so important and common, you'll end up learning them all eventually whether you want to or not. For now, you're only going to have to learn one of the readings, and that one is にち.
The sun is so hot. It focused its rays to take out one man... and that man is Friedrich Nietzsche (にち), famous philosopher. He philosophized one too many things about the sun, so the sun decided it was time he paid.
HINTS
This reading will be easier to remember if you know of Friedrich Nietzsche... so do your research and learn about him if you don't. He's a pretty historical dude. Imagine the sun totally pissed off, too. It makes a grunting noise as it builds up a sun beam to blast him off the face of the earth.
Also note that there's another reading worth learning as well: じつ. The reading can be remembered by thinking ""Gee! Two readings?"" Because, seriously, two readings? Too many...","The sun radical and sun kanji are the same, huzzah! Also, if you want to remember day as well, you can just think about how a day is the time it takes for the sun to cross the sky.
HINTS
The radical for this one is easy too, making the meaning for this kanji super easy as well!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%97%A5
47,刀,SWORD,"So now you have this sweet katana in your hands and you're swinging it around like an idiot. Feel free to make whooshing noises as you swing it around. To become a master katana wielder, you decide to travel to とうきょう (That's Tokyo!). とうきょう has the best sword and katana schools in the world, so it makes sense to travel to とうきょう.
HINTS
Imagine trying to travel to とうきょう with your katana. Airport security is not happy with you trying to take a katana on the plane, so you get a full cavity search. I hope you don't have any other swords hidden anywhere.","The radical and the meaning of this kanji are almost the same! The radical is sword, but we're learning Japanese, so can you name a Japanese sword? That's right, the most common is a katana, which happens to be the meaning of this kanji as well.
HINTS
This kanji also looks a lot like the kanji 力. To avoid getting them confused, remember that this one is missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword kanji is 90% of the power kanji).",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%88%80
48,千,THOUSAND,"Remember the thousand crosses you got stuck under while learning the radical 千? You're still under it. Then, suddenly, someone pops his head over you and says ""Hey, I'll save you... but only for a thousand cents (せん). Go ahead and try to calculate what that would come out to. It's not that expensive, actually.
HINTS
But, the problem is even though you have a thousand cents in your pocket, you can't get them out. You're stuck under all these crosses. So, your savior just shrugs and runs off, he won't help you anymore. Feel the desperateness of the situation to help yourself remember the kanji better. Hear the coins falling on the ground.","This kanji looks like and means the same thing as the radical, which makes it particularly easy to remember.
HINTS
As long as you know the radical thousand then you know the kanji thousand as well!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8D%83
49,木,TREE,"You’re walking through the trees, looking at them. They look ominous. Suddenly, you trip and fall. The trees start to mock you. Even the mocking birds mock you. It’s terrible. It’s painful. You’re being mocked as you pull yourself up off the ground.
HINTS
Feel the shame, feel the irritation. Make yourself want to run away from those dumb trees that are mocking you.","This is another kanji that is the same as the radical. Both tree and tree are the same in looks and meaning.
HINTS
So, how are those radicals doing? Do you know them well?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%9C%A8
50,水,WATER,"Imagine a lake (i.e. a whole bunch of water). When you think of water, you should try to think of this beautiful lake. It’s sunny, the trees smell nice (imagine a tree smell if you can – the more senses you use the better!) and on that tree there is an awesome tire swing (すい). You get onto the tire swing and you are swinging back and forth. The water is right in front of you, and you are able to use the swing to throw yourself into the water. It’s a lot colder than you expected, and you come back to the surface, gasping for breath. The water gets into your mouth and you taste it. How strange, it’s very, very sweet. Imagine the sweetness of the water and how weird it is (really really sweet, this water is).
HINTS
I know that was a long one, but try to imagine all the different bits. Try to feel the feelings (cold, smell, etc) too. The more you create in this fake memory (which you’re using to remember and associate water with すい (swing)) the more likely you are to end up remembering enough to make it happen. Especially when it comes to the senses part, the more vividly you imagined it, the more likely you are to remember the on’yomi.","The water radical and the water kanji are the same.
HINTS
So as long as you know the radicals, you know the kanji.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%B0%B4
51,白,WHITE,"The white team was the first to be able to hack (はく) the white iPhone.
HINTS
Imagine two teams (black and white), wearing their team colors, working really hard on hacking the iPhone. It is a huge contest, and people are watching with a lot of tension, to see who will hack the white iPhone first. Feel that tension, and see the colors separating them so vividly. The colors are important, and the excitement of the winner holding up the hacked iPhone is too.","The radical white and the kanji white are the same.
HINTS
Study your radicals hard! Most important thing!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%99%BD
52,文,WRITING,"This kanji has more than one important reading you need to learn, sorry! But don't worry, here's a mnemonic to help you:
When you're writing you need things to fuel you. That's why you always eat buns (ぶん) while you write. Bread bun, hot crossed buns, whatever as long as they're buns, they're great writing fuel.
When buns aren't enough, you call in the monster (もん) that lives under your bed. It pretends to chase you, motivating your writing even further, because if you don't write fast, you'll die by monster bites.
HINTS
Imagine shoveling buns into your mouth and running from a monster as you're writing. You're so determined! This is going to be the best thing you've ever written!","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for writing first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means writing as well.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%96%87
53,円,YEN,"What does the word yen sound like? It sounds like えん. Why? because back in the day, Japanese used to have a ""ye"" sound, but now it doesn't. Instead, it's an ""e"" sound, which is why yen = えん!
HINTS
Picture these round えん in your mind. Maybe look some up online too, just to be safe.","The combination of radicals for this kanji may not be obvious at first, but if you look carefully you'll see it. The lid is inside the head for this kanji because it's holding something in. Imagine the top of someone's head being closed by a lid. Open that lid up and peer inside... it's full of yen coins, the currency of Japan!
HINTS
Another thing that will help is to associate the word round to this kanji, because it has both of these meanings. Both are right, and if you learn one that's better than not learning either, but maybe if you think about how round the coins themselves are inside this person's head, you'll remember this one too.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%86%86
54,矢,ARROW,"To remember the reading や we use the word “Yankees” (like the evil baseball team, go M’s!).
What is this arrow doing? It’s following around all the Yankee (や) baseball players, stalking them, waiting to make its move (I’ll let you decide what its “move” is).
HINTS
Imagine the arrow as a human-sized living thing with legs, arms, and clothes, though. Strangely, it’s able to walk around even though it's an arrow. It has some kind of agenda. Make it a bit evil, if you can. What a strange thing…","The arrow radical and the arrow kanji are the same. Sort of a ""straight"" shot to memorizing this kanji, you know?
HINTS
Just know your radicals and you'll know this kanji!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%9F%A2
55,市,CITY,"This city must have a lot of sheep (し) because there is a sheep monogram on the towel. It's the sheep city.
HINTS
Imagine a city that has a sheep for its mascot. This city was built on sheep, don't you say a bad word about sheep when you're there.","You lift the lid off a manhole and there's a towel with the name of a city on it.

56,牛,COW,"Have you ever heard of わぎゅう beef? That ぎゅう is this ぎゅう.
HINTS
I hope you know what わぎゅう beef is, otherwise this will be a difficult one to learn.","The radical and the kanji for cow are exactly the same! That makes it easy to remember, so long as you know your radicals well enough.
HINTS
To distinguish this from the ""noon"" kanji (午), try thinking of the bit poking out of the top of this kanji as the cow's head.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%89%9B
57,切,CUT,"Because having seven swords for yourself is too much, you decide to take the swords and divide them up amongst pairs of people. You cut them into pairs, and give sets (せつ) to everyone who needs them in the village.
HINTS
Just make sure you think about how you need to give them away in sets, and not anything else. This is the most important thing to think about in your head as you're trying to establish the mnemonic for your kanji reading memory. It's gotta be sets.","If you have seven swords, there's only so much you can do with them. The main thing? Probably using them to cut something.
HINTS
Take these seven swords and swing them around. Cut everything in your path, including yourself. Then, think about how dumb it was to try to use seven swords at once, and then feel the pain of the cut you gave yourself. Ouch, ouch ouch.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%88%87
58,方,DIRECTION,"What direction do you always know? Which direction do you always want to go? Home (ほう). Something about your home always stays with you, no matter how far away you go. So if you're lost and you don't know which direction to go, just think of home!
HINTS
Close your eyes and picture your home in your mind. Can you tell which direction it is from where you are?","The radical and the kanji for direction are the same! Huzzah!
There is also another meaning too, though. This can also mean way as well. Think of it this way: When you move in one direction in your life, you are developing your own way. ""The way of [your name here].""
HINTS
The only direction you need to go in is forward, it's always the right way.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%96%B9
59,戸,DOOR,"You open the door and immediately get it closed back on your toe (と), literally causing your toe to explode.
HINTS
Feel the pain of your toe going away. Think about the other side of the door, where your toe is probably rolling around after it blasted off your foot.","The radical and the kanji for door are the same!
HINTS
Time to open the door to the reading part of this mnemonic.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%88%B8
60,太,FAT,"This poor fat guy has trouble with a lot of things. One of the things he has the most trouble with is tying a tie (たい).
HINTS
Imagine him trying to tie the tie but he can't lift his hands around to do it. You have to help him out. Another thing that might help you to remember this kanji's reading is that it's the same reading as 大 (or, one of the same readings). Similar kanji often have similar readings, which is a good thing to know when you have to guess (it's true with this one, anyways!).","You have a big guy here, with an extra drop of something below his thigh, hanging down. That's fat right there. He's so fat he has things of fat hanging off his fat.
HINTS
Maybe you should touch the fat below his leg just to see what it is... feel it, and squeeze it. It'll help you to remember that this kanji means ""fat.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%A4%AA
61,父,FATHER,"Imagine your father is Cheech (ちち) from Cheech and Chong.
HINTS

HINTS
Imagine this in your head. A traffic jam on a little slide, all because the shogun is using it. Picture some caution tape, orange cones, and Japanese secret service members all making sure no one gets close to the shougun while he slides. A few people are crying. They want to slide, they want to leave.","You have a small slide. The thing about small slides is that they can only fit a few people at a time.

64,毛,FUR,"With fur, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur). You’re surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel / smell like? Now it’s time to get rid of it. There’s just too much hair! To get rid of it, you’ll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi.
HINTS
Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.","Fur and fur are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean hair, too, though more like furry hair.

Imagine him using his blaster to shoot the poor triceratops in half, perfectly down the wet-dry line of its body.","A triceratops is laying out to dry. But it's so big, and it's laying on its side, so only half of it gets dry.

HINTS
This is when I start kicking you in the shin and you imagine feeling the pain of getting kicked there. As I kick you in the shin, you grab your chest... all this stress is giving you a heart attack (though your shin hurts a ton too).","The radical heart and the kanji heart are the same. Rejoice and let your heart be free!

Also, make sure you know the radicals by heart, it'll help you to learn more effectively, just like with this kanji.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%BF%83
67,内,INSIDE,"You know this kanji means inside, so you can keep thinking about the person that’s inside you, running around. You finally discover him, and try to take him out, but before you can, he pulls out a knife (ない) and threatens to cut you if you do anything irrational.
HINTS
Imagine him holding the knife out, threatening to stab your brain. You’re in a conundrum here. If you don’t take him out, you’re in trouble, but if you do try to take him out, he might stab you in the brain with his knife. Try to think a way around this situation, focusing mainly on his knife.","There's a person inside your head.
HINTS
And, you have no idea how to get them out. They're inside for good, and it's freaking you out. As in, there's a little person in there, running around, controlling your brain.

Picture all the kids out sliding on the slide at noon during their lunch break. It's hot and dry and they're very happy.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8D%88
72,北,NORTH,"You realize that this ability to find north is probably really valuable, so you go to the nearest pawn shop and hock (ほく) it. Even your fingers.
HINTS
Imagine walking out of a pawn shop after hocking your fingers and spoon and realizing that you don't know where you are. Oh, if only you could tell where north was...","Balance a spoon on your pointed fingers and it will always point north. The spoon is like a compass needle and your fingers guide the knowledge your body already has and uses it to point north. That's science, friends!
Notice how the fingers radical is a little different here? That's because you're pointing them really hard.
HINTS
Imagine taking a spoon and balancing it on your fingers. Now watch the spoon spin spin spin until it stops and ultimately points north.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8C%97
73,今,NOW,"Right now the condors (こん) are in danger! Not next week, not next year, right now! Haven't you heard that deforestation and pollution are killing all of the condors?!
HINTS
Go outside right now and do something to save the condors. If you don't do something right now there won't be enough time left!","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for now first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means now as well.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%BB%8A
74,古,OLD,"Old things are misunderstood by the 子s (こ) of the world.
*Note:* Come up with a 子 character you can use for all the こ reading mnemonics going forward. This child will show up many times throughout your mnemonic journey, and it will help if you imagine the same character the whole time.
HINTS
Imagine a 子 looking at old things. A record player. A gameboy. A cassette player. Kids just don't get old things.
Note: When you see the (古) radical in a kanji, there's a good chance it will use the reading こ.","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for old first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means old as well.
Note: This ""old"" does not refer to people. Think of it as ""old things"" instead.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%8F%A4
75,元,ORIGIN,"The origin of everything can be found in Genji (げん). Genji is the name of the main character in the world's first ever novel, ""The Tale of Genji.""
Picture him as a rich, pretty boy who cares a ton about his looks and gets along really well with all the ladies. He's also really great at poetry, which helps the lady situation.
HINTS
Genji's origin story is pretty important when it comes to mnemonics and Japanese literature. He's going to keep popping up on your kanji journey, so make sure you remember him!","The origin radical and the origin kanji are the same!
HINTS
Know your radicals!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%85%83
76,外,OUTSIDE,"You go outside (you’re not supposed to be out there at night!) and you’re accosted by a couple of guys. Then, all of a sudden, Guy (がい) Fawkes jumps from the roof above you and takes them out, then starts running. “Guy Fawkes!” you yell after him!
HINTS
If you don’t know Guy Fawkes, you should do a little reading up on him to make this mnemonic make sense. Also, Anonymous People wear a Guy Fawkes mask, if that helps any.","You're known to get the ailment evening toe, which is when your toe catches on fire after getting really, really hot (imagine this happening, ouch!). The only way to fix it is to cool your toe down, and the best way to do that is to go outside.
HINTS
After imagining your evening toe overheating, rush outside to fix it. It's the best way to prevent fire toe, which is way worse. In the evening it's nice and cold outside too, so feel this on your skin, and feel the cold air on your toe, which is starting to get some relief.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%A4%96
77,分,PART,"Now that you've cut the fish, it's time to cut something else into parts. Next on your list is the buns (ぶん) which need to be split up amongst the people. If you'd like to learn the second reading, just think about how fun (ふん) it will be to do this task.
HINTS
Think about the buns (ぶん) as absolutely delicious things you want to eat really bad. If you want to eat the buns, and you taste the buns in your imagination, you'll surely remember that the reading for this kanji is ふん as well.","The fins that fell onto my sword were sliced into two parts.
HINTS
The logic of this story makes a lot of sense - even in the kanji itself the fins are falling onto the sword from above. What happens to things that fall onto swords? They become more than one part.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%88%86
78,公,PUBLIC,"You head out into the public where everyone can see your fins, but... things have changed. All people are the same. There are thousands of こういちs walking around, and they all stare at you (though they pretend like they aren't).
HINTS
Remember, whenever we see the reading こう, think of こういち, a founder of WaniKani. We'll keep it consistent, so over time you should develop a character around こういち that you learn to love or hate.
How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become こういちs. One mother こういち--pushing a baby こういち--looks up and stares at your fins. Now you remember why you never go out in public.","You have fins in private. But, you want the world to see them, so you take them public.
HINTS
Picture yourself in private, with fins. You wish others could see them. ""That's it,"" you decide. ""It's time to show the world. I'm going to make my fins public!""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%85%AC
79,引,PULL,"When you pull the bow back, your body strains and you feel an immense heat (ひ) rise inside of you. You keep pulling and the heat grows hotter and hotter.
HINTS
Imagine using all your strength to pull on this bow. Imagine the heat rising in your body. There's sweat dripping down your face. It's so hot, but you have to keep pulling!","If you have a bow and a stick you need to pull the two back together to shoot it. If you can't pull it, you won't be shooting anything.
HINTS
Imagine taking a stick and pulling it back into your bow. Imagine how hard you have to pull. This thing is really strong!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%BC%95
80,止,STOP,"You have to stop because there is a sheep (し) in front of you. You try to walk around the sheep, but it moves to stop in front of you again. Every time the sheep stops you stop too.
HINTS
Imagine the fluffy wool of the sheep, stopping you from moving forward. You can't push past it, no matter how hard you try.","The stop radical is the same as the stop kanji.
HINTS
Know your radicals, yo!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E6%AD%A2
81,用,TASK,"Today, your task is to eat yogurt (よう). It's nutritious, it's delicious, and I'm telling you to do it, so you have to. A task is basically just something you have to do, so that's what this is.
HINTS
Eat your yogurt. (Gogurt doesn't count, don't @ me.)","The kanji and the radical are the same, so remembering the meaning of this kanji is as simple as making sure you know the radical for task first! If you know the radical, you know this kanji means task as well.
HINTS
Make sure you know those radicals, yo!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E7%94%A8
82,万,TEN THOUSAND,"Now that you have ten thousand pieces of tiny leaf paper, you decide to turn them into a manga (まん)! Each little leaf piece will become a panel.
HINTS
Carefully draw your manga onto these ten thousand leaf pieces. Maybe you even use your sword again to give them some textured details. You're so creative and talented!","You cut the leaf with your sword into ten thousand pieces!
HINTS
If you can get to ten thousand different pieces, then that means your sword is absolutely perfect. If your sword dulls before you get to ten thousand, you have to throw it away.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E4%B8%87
83,広,WIDE,"You like being wide because it makes you feel like a different person. But not just any person, like a super hero (ひろ)!
HINTS
Picture yourself laying under your wide, private canopy pretending to be a super hero on the ground. You're stretching a nice, wide super hero pose, like you're flying through the sky.","The canopy you use in private is very wide.
HINTS
You want your private canopy to be wide so you can sprawl out under it is as much as you want. No one's going to come in and tell you to close your legs or sit up straight. So it can be as wide as you like!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%BA%83
84,冬,WINTER,"Winter is the time of year you give out presents: ""one fo' you, one fo'you. And... not you, this one's not fo' you so fu’ you! (ふゆ)!
HINTS
Note, be careful: this kanji is a little different from the radical 夂 though has the same meaning… but don’t let that fool you (ふゆ).","We have the winter radical and the two radical (though it's sort of slanted). What's two times the winter radical, if radicals are just a part of a kanji? Two times would be enough to create the entire kanji, which is also winter.
HINTS
You could also think, ""Winter too"" instead of ""two."" Because, this kanji is in fact ""winter too.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/kanji/%E5%86%AC
