0,亅,BARB,"This radical is shaped like a barb. Like the kind you'd see on barb wire. Imagine one of these getting stuck to your arm or your clothes. Think about how much it would hurt with that little hook on the end sticking into you. Say out loud, ""Oh dang, I got a barb stuck in me!""",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/barb
1,大,BIG,"This radical looks just like a stick figure—more specifically, a really big guy with his arms stretched out nice and big. When you see this radical, just think big, because this guy is really BIG!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/big
2,工,CONSTRUCTION,"You know those big steel girders that are used for the frame of big buildings? This is like the end of one of those, and have a very distinct shape, just like this radical. These girders are used in construction, which is why this radical means construction. Funny thing is, you use these girders to put together buildings just like you're going to use this radical to put together kanji!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/construction
3,十,CROSS,"This radical looks like a cross. I mean, just look at it. Two bars going through each other = a cross!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/cross
4,丶,DROP,"This little radical is a drop of water or some other liquid. Notice how it's only one drop? Sometimes radicals or kanji will have more than one drop, so it's important that you know how to tell them apart.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/drop
5,入,ENTER,"Watch out! This isn't the person radical, it's something else. What's the difference? The right side is longer than the left side. And on computers, it usually has that extra part sticking out of the top. It kind of looks like a flap opening to a teepee. And what do you do with an opening? You enter it! That's why this radical is enter.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/enter
6,ハ,FINS,"Picture a fish. Now picture the fish a little worse, like a child's drawing of the fish. Now erase the fish's body and... you're left with two fins! Do you see these two fins? Yeah, you see them.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/fins
7,一,GROUND,"This radical consists of a single, horizontal stroke. What's the biggest, single, horizontal stroke? That's the ground. Look at the ground, look at this radical, now look at the ground again. Kind of the same, right?",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/ground
8,,GUN,"This looks a lot like a long gun pointing to the right. You have a shoulder rest on the left, and the barrel on the right. Imagine it hanging in a case on the wall in a museum.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/gun
9,,LEAF,"There's a leaf on top and a stem going down out of it, making it the leaf radical. It looks kind of like a lilypad, sitting on top of the water with its stem going down to the bottom where the dirt is.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/leaf
10,亠,LID,"This looks like something you'd put on a kettle or a pot, right? It even has a little handle to make sure you don't burn yourself. This is some kind of lid.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/lid
11,山,MOUNTAIN,"This is a mountain. You'll have to add the lines that make up the top of the mountain if you want it more ""mountain-like."" Also something that might help: sometimes mountains have a couple of smaller peaks coming out the side of the main peak too. Connect the dots and create the mountain in your mind.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/mountain
12,口,MOUTH,"A big, gaping, square hole represents someone opening their giant mouth to tell you something stupid.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/mouth
13,九,NINE,"If you look at this radical in just the right way, you'll notice that it kind of looks like the letters ""n"" and ""i"" (the ""i"" comes from the little flippy-up stroke on the right side). What do the letters ""n"" and ""i"" start spelling? Why, the word nine.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/nine
14,人,PERSON,"If you were to draw a person with just strokes like you see in kanji, you'd create a stick figure, maybe something like this: 大. But this is just a person, not someone holding out their arms to show how big they are. So their arms are down, which makes them look like a torso with a pair of legs. Maybe they're walking too, which is why their legs are spread out like that. You can see the person now, can't you?",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/person
15,力,POWER,Imagine a guy flexing his arm downward to show off his steroid-pumped arm. It's huge. It's so full of power. RARRRWWWRRR!!,1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/power
16,勹,PRISON,"This looks like an enclosure of sorts - that's why it's a prison. It wraps itself around things and locks them in there. Prisons are pretty scary, even before you imagine one slowly floating down from the sky to trap you.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/prison
17,川,RIVER,"This radical already looks like a river. See the banks of the river on the side and the flow of the river in the middle? There's even a slight turn in the river too. So when you see this radical, you should think ""river.""",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/river
18,七,SEVEN,"What does this radical look like? Hmm, nothing much. What about if you turn it upside down? Now does it look like a 7 with a line through it? Close enough to help you to remember that this radical is seven, right? Just remember, when you see this radical, flip it over and see what number it looks like. If you can do that, you can remember the meaning!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/seven
19,丿,SLIDE,"Close your eyes and imagine you're a kid again. Now open them and... look! It's a slide! Imagine little you sliding down this slide over and over, having a great time. Imagination + emotion makes for good memorization!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/slide
20,,STICK,"This is a stick, sticking out of the ground. It even looks like a stick.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/stick
21,日,SUN,"Since there are no circles in Japanese characters, sometimes rectangles or squares have to make do. In this case, this big rectangle is the sun. The middle line going through the center horizontally is the equator. Or maybe it's a cloud, moving across the sun. Picture it, but don't actually look at the sun and burn your eyes!",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/sun
22,ト,TOE,"This radical looks just like the katakana character ト (to), which sounds like the word toe. So when you see ト, think toe.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/toe
23,木,TREE,"Do you see the tree in here? It has branches, and then it has the foliage coming down diagonally from it, spreading out like a tree would. That's why this radical is a tree.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/tree
24,二,TWO,"One line plus another line equals two lines. This radical represents the number two. Pretty simple, right? Can you guess what three looks like? I bet you can...",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/two
25,女,WOMAN,"This radical looks like a wide person made up of two stacked Xs. Women generally have two XXs for chromosomes, and back in the day they were praised for their wide, child-bearing hips. We may not think of women this way anymore, but way back when Japanese was made, this made them think of a woman.",1,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/woman
26,本,BOOK,There's a cut right at the base of this tree. Why would someone cut down a tree? To make a book out of it! Imagine living in the old days when you'd have to cut down a tree yourself to write or read a book.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/book
27,弓,BOW,This radical looks like a fancy composite bow people would use to shoot at targets and definitely not any normal living animals. See how the middle part is being pulled back? Imagine holding this bow and firing it at a target shaped like a giant alligator-crab monster.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/bow
28,子,CHILD,"This radical is made up of two barbs and one ground radical. If there are barbs on the ground, whom (especially) do you want to avoid that area? You want your child to avoid it, since children are so careless and often don't wear shoes. Imagine how bad you'd feel if you let a child walk around on top of these barbs! Pretty bad, I imagine.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/child
29,牛,COW,"There's a cross and a gun, with the gun going through the cross. You're using the cross to stabilize your gun, because you need to shoot a cow for dinner. You bring your cross because you need to bless the cow once you've killed it (and it's also a good stand for your gun). Poor cow.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/cow
30,土,DIRT,"There's a cross drawn on the ground, making this dirt. You can draw anything in the dirt, it just happens to be a cross this time. Imagine drawing a cross in the dirt with your finger. Feel the dirt get stuck under your fingernail and never forget.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/dirt
31,犬,DOG,"Remember the big guy that helped you remember the big radical? Now the big guy has something on his shoulder... what is that? You look and see that he has a dog up there, perched as if it were a parrot or a cat or something. Dogs aren't supposed to be up on people's shoulders like that, but for him? It works!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/dog
32,夕,EVENING,"Do you see the prison and drop radicals making up this radical? This prison is holding onto a drop because it's the evening. Evening air does a better job of holding on to drops of liquid like this, which is why everything is covered in dew in the morning.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/evening
33,目,EYE,"See the iris in the middle of the eyeball? Remember that there are no round things in kanji, so square things take their place. That makes this a pretty realistic, square eye. You just have to squint with your real eyes a bit.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/eye
34,火,FIRE,"See the person radical here? It's got things coming off of it... what are those things—OH MY GOD IT'S FIRE!!! Help, help! Put the fire out!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/fire
35,五,FIVE,"If you use your imagination, this radical actually looks like the number ""5."" You have to remove the vertical line in the bottom left, but once you do that, you have an easy way to remember that this radical means five.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/five
36,尸,FLAG,"See the flag in this radical? There's a pole with a flag on the end of it, blowing in the wind. Basically, this radical looks just like a flag.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/flag
37,彡,HAIR,"These three streaks flowing off to the side are three strands of hair. Pretty easy to see and remember, right?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/hair
38,手,HAND,"This one's a little tough to picture, but I believe in you. The barb in the middle is the wrist/arm. Then, there are four regular fingers coming off of it and then one big thumb (the slide radical at the top). So you have four fingers, a thumb, and a wrist. This is what makes up your crazy looking hand.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/hand
39,冂,HEAD,"This is the kind of head a child might draw—can you imagine it with eyes, nose, mouth, and ears too? Whoever's head this is, it's really square. Maybe it's the head of a famous spongy cartoon character. Hmm.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/head
40,天,HEAVEN,"There is a two radical and a person radical. The first level of a person's life is on earth. The second level (this level, which is why there's a two radical here) is in heaven. So when you see a person at level 2, you know they're in heaven.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/heaven
41,王,KING,This radical is not something anyone can have. Only a king can wear this crown upon his head. This radical is the sign of kings. Imagine your favorite king wearing this on their head. It's a pretty distinctive shape—I think you can do it.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/king
42,儿,LEGS,"This radical already looks like a pair of legs. There's even feet on these legs (unlike the fins radical, which you learned earlier). That's how you know these are legs and not fins (or something else).",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/legs
43,中,MIDDLE,"There's a stick going right through the middle of someone's mouth! Imagine that mouth being yours. Measure the placement of the stick. Perfectly aligned, right in the middle. That's amazing, though to be honest, you probably have bigger problems than measuring the location of this stick in your mouth.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/middle
44,月,MOON,"The moon is actually made of the sun, but it has little legs coming off of it leaning towards the left. Why? Because the moon is always running away from the sun as fast as it can. It doesn't want to get caught on fire, so it has to run to stay ahead!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/moon
45,ナ,NARWHAL,"This radical looks like the katakana character ナ (na), which we're going to say stands for narwhal. Plus, this radical kind of looks like a narwhal, right? The body and head on the bottom, and the single majestic narwhal horn coming out the top, shooting up out of the water and into the air. Oh, and don't confuse this radical with treasure. The sideways line for narwhal (ナ) is horizontal, the sideways line for treasure is at more of a downward angle (メ), like an ""X.""",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/narwhal
46,ム,PRIVATE,"This is a little triangle that's almost completely closed off. When you want to be alone, you hide in a place where you can be in private. That's why this is the private radical. You're closing yourself off to the rest of the world, with just a little peephole.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/private
47,田,RICE PADDY,Rice paddies are made up of fields with irrigation lines going between them. See the four rice paddies with water flowing between and around them? That's why this radical is rice paddy.,2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/rice-paddy
48,小,SMALL,"You have fins and you have a barb. A fish that you can stick an entire barb through like this would have to be really small, since it's sticking through the whole fish body (which you can imagine by basing the body off the size of the fins compared to the already small barb.)",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/small
49,立,STAND,"Two sticks are propping up a lid. By doing this, they're making it stand up.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/stand
50,石,STONE,"There's a leaf growing out of a square thing (which is normally a mouth, but not this time). The leaf is growing out of a stone. I mean, obviously, because leaves don't grow out of mouths. I hope. Anyway, picture a stone in the middle of nature with a leaf growing out of it or just behind it and you'll never forget this radical!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/stone
51,又,STOOL,"This looks just like a fold-out stool, amiright?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/stool
52,止,STOP,"There's a giant toe and a stick in the ground in front of you. You're driving your car toward them, but you don't see them until your lights hit them. What would these things cause you to do? Most likely stop your car right away.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/stop
53,丁,STREET,"There's a barb under the ground, holding it in place. This is actually a street. All streets have to be secured to the ground with barbs so that they don't slide all over the place. If you tried to pick up the asphalt streets we have today, you'd still find barbs under the ground to keep them there. The more you know! ⭐",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/street
54,刀,SWORD,"If you look at this radical, it looks like the bottom part of a sword—the handle, more specifically. This radical also looks a lot like the power radical (力), so don't get them confused. It's missing the little nubbin at the top, because 90% of the power comes from the sword to cut your enemies down (which is why the sword radical is 90% of the power radical).",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/sword
55,千,THOUSAND,"You're in a room, surrounded by slides. Down off the slides tumble cross after cross after cross. They're bouncing in and hitting you in the face, the arm, everywhere... With each cross comes a voice yelling, ""ONE! TWO! THREE HUNDRED! FIVE HUNDRED!"" and so on. You are worried it will never end, because you're starting to drown in the crosses. Then the voice yells out ONE THOUSAND and they stop. Still, you can't move. Think about all the numbers being called out, and keep wondering if it'll be the last one. Feel the relief you'd feel if it stops on a thousand, because you won't be buried anymore. The thousand crosses are covering you entirely, over your head, but because they're crosses you can still breathe.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/thousand
56,メ,TREASURE,"This radical is treasure because ""X marks the spot,"" as they say. Doesn't it look like the X on a pirate treasure map? You want to go find that treasure now, right?!",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/treasure
57,水,WATER,"There are drops of liquid coming out of both sides of this barb. You can imagine the barb being stuck into the ground then pulled out. When it is, water comes gushing out of both sides! That's why this radical is water.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/water
58,白,WHITE,"Add a drop of the sun to something and it will turn it white. The sun is really strong, so even a single drop will burn anything white. Why do you think so many beaches are white? Even the drops of sunblock you use to stop the sun's rays is white. So when you think of sun drops, think white.",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/white
59,文,WRITING,"This looks like a stool with a lid on it, but it's actually a writing desk. Do you see it? It's a nice, quiet place for writing. You can even see the pen sticking up in the middle. Wouldn't you want to do your writing here?",2,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/writing
60,矢,ARROW,"You have a really big gun. Why? Because only big guns will be able to shoot arrows! Bullets are pretty small, so the guns that shoot them can be any size. But you need a big gun if you want to shove an arrow in it and then shoot it at your enemies.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/arrow
61,广,CANOPY,"This is a canopy. See the cloth draping down and the little point at the middle holding it up? You could sit under here and enjoy a bright, summer day without getting any sun!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/canopy
62,方,DIRECTION,This radical looks like a dude running off to the right. He's heading in a very distinct direction. Which direction was it again?,3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/direction
63,戸,DOOR,"Where does a flag usually go? It goes over a door. I know the 一 radical usually means ground, but in this case we're going to say the flag is in the doorway (where the 一 is the top of the door).",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/door
64,干,DRY,"You have two on a stick. Two what? Well, you can't tell because they're too dry. Someone put two somethings on this stick to dry, but they seem to have left them out for way too long. Was it meat? Fish? Cucumbers? You have no clue, but they're two very dry somethings, that's for sure.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/dry
65,父,FATHER,"There are fins covering the treasure making up this radical. You pull away the fins and start digging where the X is (because ""X"" marks where the treasure is, right?). When you dig down, instead of finding treasure, you find your father. The shock of this in your imagination should help you to remember the meaning of this radical!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/father
66,扌,FINGERS,"This looks like the hand (手) radical, but smaller. That's because it's just the fingers. You don't always have room for a whole hand to be in a kanji, but there's always space for a few fingers.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/fingers
67,毛,FUR,"Do you remember the hair radical? This is like that, except now the hair is attached to a tail. Animals don't usually have hair, though. Instead, they have fur.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/fur
68,,HAT,Do you know those rice paddy hats? The ones shaped just like this radical? That's why this radical is a hat.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/hat
69,心,HEART,"Take a good look at this one. It kind of looks like a heart (not the stereotypical Valentine’s Day heart, though). Think of a real heart. Basically, there’s a lump (the heart) in the middle, and three lines which make up the arteries that go in and out of the heart to keep you alive. This radical shows up a lot, so it shouldn’t be too hard to learn it as you go along. Remember, lump (heart) plus arteries equals a heart… like, a real heart, not the fake, pretty kind.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/heart
70,生,LIFE,"This radical consists of a cow radical with the ground radical below it. If you have cows on solid ground, then you really do have a good life, I think. Sometimes this radical will show up without the slide part on the side too, though we'll treat them both as ""life.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/life
71,今,NOW,"This is a hat on top of the katakana for ""ra."" Think of Ra, the Egyptian god. When is Ra wearing a hat? Right now! It's always now, because he never takes it off. No really, look it up, it's true.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/now
72,古,OLD,"You have a cross on a mouth—that's a pretty religious mouth. Who speaks the most about religion? Old people, mostly. Also, think about the teachings of religion itself - also pretty old, age-wise. No matter how you look at it, everything about this radical is kind of ""old.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/old
73,元,ORIGIN,"You have two legs making up this radical. Between two legs is where you came from, no matter how you look at it. These two legs are your origin.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/origin
74,幺,POOP,"There's something sticking out of you while you're in private. It's poop! You can't just poop in public, that's illegal and gross in this day and age. So the next time something starts to come out of you when you're in private, think, ""Ah yes, it's poop.""",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/poop
75,匕,SPOON,"This radical looks like a spoon! Well, a spoon that's been bent a lot by an angry person or a psychic. Go grab a spoon and try to bend it into this shape. Then hold on to it so you'll never forget that this is the spoon radical!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/spoon
76,用,TASK,"This looks a bit like a calendar with spaces for you to write in your tasks for the day. See those blank sections? Make sure you write down your daily tasks, so you don't forget to do something important!",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/task
77,巾,TOWEL,There's something draped over that stick. It's a towel!! Imagine taking a wet towel and hanging it over a railing or a stick so it won't get all musty and gross. It would look just like this.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/towel
78,,TRICERATOPS,"The three horns represent the triceratops, one of the most awesome dinosaurs ever.",3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/triceratops
79,夂,WINTER,This radical looks like the evening radical but has an extra long stroke. That's because evenings are long in the winter. It gets dark super early.,3,https://www.wanikani.com/radicals/winter
