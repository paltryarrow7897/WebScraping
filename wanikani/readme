# About WaniKani

WaniKani is a web application that helps people learn Japanese kanji and associated vocabulary. 
It uses radicals, mnemonics, and a spaced repetition learning system in order to help its users memorize the characters and vocabulary more effectively.

WaniKani divides radicals, kanji and vocabulary into levels from 1 to 60.
The first 3 levels are free so go try them out. Rest are available by subscriptions.

# About this script

This script finds all radicals, kanji and vocabulary in a given level.
Result is saved in 3 CSV files, one each for radicals, kanji and vocabulary.

# Usage

I primarily use Microsoft Edge so my script uses Edge Web Driver for Selenium. You'll need to have edge installed to run this script.

Run the script with 2 arguments, first is the start level, second is the end level.

For example, to get all radicals, kanji and vocabulary from level 1 to 60, run
python3 wanikaniScraper.py 1 60

Or to get everything from the free first 3 levels, run
python3 wanikaniScraper.py 1 3

Output files are named as [radical/kanji/vocabulary]_{start_level}_{end_level}.csv

Errors are not handled yet, so anything unexpected results with an open Selenium web driver.
